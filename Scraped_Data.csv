"I am so shocked that I have to write this, but it's based on THIS location and not the other location I I went to. We order doordash (pretty simple, right) 2 fried chicken meals (one with white meat mash potatoes/green beans) and the other a spicy fried chicken meal (Dark meat, Mac and cheese with collard greens). Nothing crazy or complicated.When it arrived, it was cold, with overcooked chicken that was not even correct. My meal didn't even have collard greens, and the mac/cheese was pathetic. Our chicken was atrocious, and we couldn't even east it. Doordarshan gave us credit, and this meal was not cheap either (nearly 90 bucks)I will not be going to this location. Don't let that 4 star rating fool you.",1
"DO NOT BE MISLED BY THEIR REVIEW RATING--CONSIDER THIS A WARNING.As someone that's enjoyed the experiences at the Tysons location, the service we experienced today at this DC location was well below acceptable standards. For a restaurant with such strong reviews, the level of service was shockingly poor. The food was mediocre at its best, delayed significantly. We had to ask for our appetizer, which came without utensils or napkins--another 10 minutes until we had to request them from another staff.  A noticeable lack of attentiveness from the server, who didn't check on us or refill our water, despite our glasses being empty for some time. No syrup with pancakes until we had to wait for the server to walk by and stop the server to remind him. Two tables behind and front of us that were seated after us were served well before us. The overall experience was far from what I've come to expect. While the place was busy, that doesn't excuse the poor service. The entire experience left such a bad taste, particularly given the circumstances of hosting a farewell. This was a disappointing visit and not reflective of the standard one should expect from a restaurant with such reviews.",1
"Abusive pricing system, overworked and not enough staff, tables stacked up against each other, screaming babies, bad food. The great: the wait is long, the place was packed, the farm to table sales pitch was top notch. People want to be here. The good: nice bathrooms, good candy packages to go. Good water bottle so you can refill your own glass. The cornbread is very corny, obviously homemade and good. I recommend it. The average: the beer list was underwhelming and the beers on tap are rated very low on untapped.The poor: the wait staff is so overwhelmed and overworked they can't ask you how your food or drink is. If you have a problem good luck. I had to waive down a waiter when the family next to me broke a glass on the table. The tables are jammed so close together the staff has to be fairly acrobatic to get around and too few of them. The restaurant doesn't care cause $$$The terrible. Where to begin. You should not leave a place hungry but here we are. Food was nuclear  (spicy), could not touch it, left food uneaten, pushed my salad around a bit. My old fashioned bourbon drink was a sugary mess couldn't go further than a sip. It should have some taste other than sugar.  Maybe there should be a general warning to northern yankees?   I didn't complain about food or drink, so that's on me, but honestly staff has no time and didn't ask why my dinner and drink were full.  They don't even ask ""how did you like it"" but again they are carrying massive loads all the time. We gave a bit more than 20% tip. Poor guy earned it. The ""cover your eyes"": the pricing. A 5% surtax for workers mental health, a 12% sales tax, those two combined are nearly 20% of the bill. Then a 20% tip on the food and on those 2 items. Let's distribute the nearly 40% on the prices. Small Glass of wine $24 (how much was the larger glass version) cornbread $16, the 4 very small shrimp added to salad $13.  Can they just list the actual price and be done with the +5%+12%+20% formula, shouldn't be a math class.",1
"One of the most overrated (if not the most overrated) restaurants in Washington, D.C., and has been for years. I have been here a few times over the years and the food has not been top-notch since at least 2011. I recently went with some colleagues for a weekday lunch and was once again disappointed. We had an 11:30 reservation, intentionally scheduled before the lunch rush. While our party was immediately seated and we were able to quickly order drinks, our server did not return to our table for over 15 minutes, even though the restaurant was half empty. After we finally flagged our server and put in our orders, the food took over 15 minutes to come. Once we got the food, it was extremely mediocre. I started with a cup of coffee, which was weak and rather tasteless-it was only a step or two up from airplane coffee. I drink my coffee black and I expect that a restaurant of this caliber could make a cup of coffee that does not need cream and sugar to taste good; needless to say they did not.I got the fried chicken and waffles for my main dish and it left much to be desired. The only good part of the dish was the breast meat, which was juicy. Otherwise, the gravy was tasteless and added nothing, the syrup tasted artificial, the waffle was something that I would get at a budget hotel breakfast, and the butter was slathered over the waffle, rather than in a carafe where I could spread it myself. For dessert, our group shared some chocolate cake, which was dry and flavorless other than the icing. It did not even taste store-bought; store-bought is better.If you are going to try one of the restaurants in this group, I recommend Farmers and Distillers. If you want to have lunch in Foggy Bottom, go to one of the casual places at 20th St and I St NW.",1
"This review is for food only as I ordered takeout. I was so excited because the menu looks terrific. I had the fried chicken which had absolutely zero flavor. Zero taste. It was cooked just fine but with no seasoning or flavor. The macaroni and cheese was lacking flavor as well and the mashed potatoes were OK at best but was missing gravy.                   The fried okra would've been good. It was cooked well but again no seasoning at all. The chef needs to use some seasoned salt or garlic salt or something anything. The peanut butter pie was a joke. I expected a peanut butter mousse made with, sweetened condensed milk, whipped cream, etc. with peanut butter but instead it was only peanut butter itself. It was awful to say the least. Got to say thumbs down. Terrific menu, awful execution.",1
"By far one of the most traumatic eating experiences. Everything was fine untill I started eating my meal and I realized the texture of the chicken was off. I had asked myself, is this cooked? Unfortunately  to my surprise it was not, the chicken was pink. I called my waiter over and asked for it to be sent back. Lo and behold the second meal that came back was still not fully cocked. Completely ruined my night. I don't know if it was because it was close to closing and the kitchen was over it but it sure seemed like it. I spoke to the manager and she acknowledged that the chicken was not cooked and comped the bill. I didn't feel  think they took it very seriously considering you know salmonella and all... This use to be one of my favorite food chain but since this happened I haven't been able to go back. My friend order pasta and I guess it was slightly underdone so she got fried rice instead which I had a taste of and it was pretty good.",1
"One of the worst lunches we had during this vacation, if not the worst. It started off well, the hostess greeted us kindly and we were sat quickly. However, our server that came (didn't introduce herself so not sure what her name is) came with dirty water cups. We couldn't get clean cups until we were half way through our entrees because our server never came to check on us. When we got too thirsty, we asked the hostess, who said she couldn't leave the host stand and told us to wait for our server or another staff.The food was also terribly mediocre. I ordered the fried chicken with waffles and my sister ordered an avocado toast. The chicken was too salty, the green beans were tasteless/no seasoning, and the avocado toast was also too salty. We had chips and dips as appetizer which was the best dish out of the three. The only downside was the extra salsa came after we finished the chips. The lady manager with glasses was very sweet, though. She only came at the very end when we were leaving but her kind remarks improved the ending of this highly disappointing lunch. Overall, we had high expectations from all the great reviews and the recommendations from the blogs. We left unhappy with our choice and will not be coming back.",1
"We planned to have Christmas dinner here.  We booked reservations for 5:15 pm.  Arrived at 4:45 pm and upon our arrival, the line to check in was long.  We check in and were told a 30 min to 1 hour wait from our reservation time, not 4:45 pm.  We were told they overbooked and when you  we went to the Open Table app, they were still taking reservations for 5:30 pm.  We confirmed our reservation via phone (see screenshot of voicemail) and called to confirm. I am not sure who is managing, though I sure overbooking is good to compensate for those who do not show up but this is awful.  Then being charged $20 to hold when booking, well SMDH.  I can say, they made our first Christmas away from home a memorable one.....but we found a restaurant who met...far exceeded our expectations and recommend Toryumon Japanese Restaurant",1
"DO NOT ORDER THEM THROUGH UBER EATS!! I guess they feel, ""you'll get what I send you""! I got my fried chicken salad and guess what was in the container...LETTUCE, ONE tomato HALF and chicken! REALLY?! Thank goodness I had salad dressing, onions and everything else that SHOULD HAVE BEEN in the salad! Maybe that was the universe telling me next I have the stuff at home just make it myself?! If they didn't have the ingredients, a call would've been nice and I would have had the opportunity to choose a replacement! Just TERRIBLE!",1
"The Southern Chicken salad and the fried shrimp are absolutely divine. Their almond chocolate bar is scrumpdillyumptious (if you're lucky to snag one...they sell out FAST)! Shrimp rolls are super yummy too! ONLY ONE thing that I got and didn't care for were the shrimp dumplings! My taste buds just didn't ""get it""!Customer service and ambiance are amazing and this is one of my go to spots! I am sure you will enjoy them as much as I do!! Enjoy!",1
"Overall a poor dining experience. Started off with the prosciutto farm bread which was decent. I would give it a 5/10 because it was covered with way too much balsamic. The quality of prosciutto was good though. The main issue was the entree. I ordered the sausage and mushroom gnocchi, which was unfortunately a huge let down. The sausage crumbles was burnt to a crisp on one side, and it ruined the flavor of the entire dish. The gnocchi and mushrooms all had an extremely burnt aftertaste. When the waiter asked how the food was, we said one of the dishes had a problem, and he just said ""okay"" without any further questions or help. Would definitely not come back here ever again.",1
"Terrible experience having Founding Farmers for dinner.
The service was great, very attentive waiter BUT the food - not so much, poorly flavored prime rib (never getting here again) under cooked sweet potato (Also,since when does a sweet potato only have one side?) and undercooked green beans. I do not recommend this meal - the ambience is lackluster.",1
"Don't get the strawberry and
Cream waffle plate. I poured the syrup on it and completely messed up my food. It was extremely runny and it tasted like it had high fructose corn syrup all in it! No thanks",1
"Upon being seated to celebrate an occasion with guests, we heard a thunderous grinding of coffee beans adjacent to our table. We could not hear ourselves think, let alone talk. That's hardly the atmosphere we wanted for a celebration of any type! The machinery should have been placed in the kitchen, away from guests. Moreover, we will not return until Customer 'Care' enters the equation.",1
"The bathrooms are unwell kept and look like a gas station. My server was very kind and helpful but the other employees were not as friendly.
A server came in to wait for the restroom and she accidentally turned the lights off but left me in the dark to use the restroom. The restrooms are very dirty, no toilet paper in the rolls, water everywhere all over the floors, toilet paper everywhere on the floor. A restroom says a lot about a restaurant and if it's unkept there for patrons to use, I wonder what their kitchen looks like where nobody can see it.
Disgusting, will not come back.",1
"Our server was nice. We were able to secure a reservation 15 minutes before the desired dining time. But the food... the food. Left so much to be desired based on these current Yelp ratings and reviews. I ordered the fried chicken salad with extra dressing and a draft shock top. My mom ordered the cracker crusted shrimp. My dad ordered the farmhouse platter and my son had the baby burgers appetizer (because they don't have a kids menu). My beer was a little warm when it arrived. My salad arrived missing half of the toppings and featuring overcooked/burnt panko-breaded chicken cutlet strips. It looked so unappetizing, so I took the errors in the order as my opportunity to forgo any additional entree at the restaurant. I ended up splitting my mom's shrimp entree because we both weren't too hungry. So regarding the shrimp, it was okay but just not seasoned. It put me in the mind of red lobster as far as the flavor. The cornbread that came with the shrimp appeared to be yellow cake with corn kernels. None at my table were brave enough to actually try it. My toddler son currently prefers a plain hamburger patty so he had no issues. I could tell the fries served with the burgers and shrimp had the potential to be good but they weren't fresh. So the server did replace them and the fresh ones were good with salt and pepper added. My dad's farmhouse platter - in summary, the ribs aren't grilled, the fried chicken was dry, hard, and unseasoned, and again, the burgers were okay.",1
For the money that they are charging the food at the buffet was cold af! Asked my server several times for something never got it. very limited selection ended up going else where to get my money worth. this is a prime example of the food not living up to the name of the establishment shame too because this used to be a nice place,1
"Reservation made 6 weeks ago. Arrived 20 minutes early to check in and...
Having a 5 pm reservation and being told you can't seat us ""for at least 45 minutes"" is VERY unacceptable and unprofessional. Do better!",1
"Our server was in training, so we were prepared to be patient. For having a trainee who definitely didn't understand food it was ""okay"". She didn't seem to know the menu and explained things to us that didn't really make sense. (""Risotto is a rice-like pasta."" And ""Pinot Grigio is white wine."") However, she was friendly and made a point of sitting down everything.
Our cocktail order took over 30 minutes to arrive. We had half of our appetizers delivered before we saw the drinks. Also our apps arrived in 3 stages with the last round of apps delivered only minutes before our entrees.
I ordered the scallop dish. There was a weird pool of oil on the dish and when I asked the server she looked confused and got a manager. He looked at the pool of oil and said ""we melt a little butter on top at the end"". I was clearly unhappy with it but he just walked away. Also the risotto was BURIED in parsley. 2 of us ordered risotto dishes and with both the risotto was half undercooked and half mush. One of our party had the gnocchi-- she was sick that night. In general, the service was confused and spotty and the food was mediocre at best. Would definitely not recommend.",1
Great service at the bar but food wasn't what I expected. Grilled Chicken bacon salad water at the bottom of plate bacon was inedible didn't know you can mess up a salad but it's possible Chicken Salad*,1
"It was about a month ago when we decided to eat at FF due to its proximity near the Kennedy Center. It may have been an odd night or they had the B team working the kitchen. All of the food was bland and tasteless. It was so weird as I always thought this was a restaurant that prided it self on farm to table food.
Don't let the name Founding Farmers fool you. What they served us, we could have gotten at Applebees.",1
"Very disappointed in my experience at this location. I have tried other locations and been very impressed so this experience was a major disappointment.
I ordered on a Sunday night for delivery -- I ordered milk chocolate caramels, sausage mushroom gnocchi, chocolate cake, and a vanilla latte.
First, I was disappointed with my delivery experience. When ordering chocolates, I wouldn't recommend them to be placed on top of the gnocchi because the heat caused the bottom chocolates to melt. Also the delivery charges are interesting... delivery charge of $2.99, a packaging fee of $2.06, and a utensil fee of $0.60.
Concerning the food itself --
The vanilla latte itself was very small, really anytime I order a coffee and the coffee is barely more than half the cup then I am disappointed off the bat, regardless of the taste.
The sausage mushroom gnocchi was extremely salty that it was hard to eat, especially considering that sausage itself is already salty.
The chocolate cake was very one dimensional. When you buy in store it comes with vanilla ice cream but it does not come with vanilla ice cream when you get delivery.",1
"We arrived as a walk-in at 9:28am. Hostess told us it would be approx. 35-40min wait time for INDOOR seating so we left our name/number. Granted, it is a Saturday morning and they're busy...we check back after an hour and they told us we were 2nd in line for the next available spot...
25mins later another hostess brought us to outdoor seating (which there was plenty of). We explained to them that we were waiting on INDOOR seating but they said we were backed up and running late on reservations. They even told us they have these heat lamps and assured us everyone will stay warm! It's the middle of November, we were contemplating staying but didn't see a waitress at all close-by. Felt like a huge waste of time especially steering us outside. Definitely not comfortably to eat, would not recommend",1
"Don't go to Founding Farmer's if you would like them to accomodate a fish allergy. I went with my wife (who has a fish allergy). She was asking which otems would be safe to eat (a green salad for instance). She was asked if she is OK with cross-contamination????????? What? They said that everything is prepared together and cross-contaminated- their wording. I asked if they could make a fresh salad away from fish and the answer was no- there is fish everywhere.
Very disappointed.",1
Horrible horrible customer service! Makes me never want to return. My brother was treated with no respect and we were the guests. Just throw the whole restaurant away.,1
"Disappointing Food, But Great ServiceWe recently dined at The Founding Fathers, and while we were impressed with the service, the food left much to be desired. The staff was attentive, friendly, and accommodating, which we truly appreciated. However, our meal didn't meet expectations.We ordered steak, which turned out to be tough and not enjoyable. For a restaurant of this caliber, we expected much better quality. Unfortunately, the food was a significant disappointment and overshadowed the otherwise excellent service.It's unfortunate that our dining experience fell short because the team's effort and hospitality were fantastic. We hope the kitchen can address these issues to match the high standard set by the front-of-house staff.",2
"We had a reservation on a Sunday afternoon and it was PACKED! Even with the reservation it took 20+ mins to be seated, so definitely recommend a reservation. With how busy it was, service was still pretty good. The ambiance is cozy and there's plenty of upstairs seating. The food however was extremely lack luster. The beignets were actually pretty tasty, but the spinach dip wasn't very good and the blueberry compote waffles were just sad. I don't really understand the hype around this place. I definitely wouldn't come back!",2
"I'm still trying to process the disappointing dinner experience at Founding Farmers - Washington. The service was painfully slow, and the staff seemed overwhelmed.To make matters worse, we were seated at our table only to have a large family seated right next to us shortly after. You'd think they'd prioritize the guests who arrived first, but nope! The family received their food and drinks before us, despite arriving after us.The food itself was a letdown. Overpriced and underseasoned, the fried chicken dish was a disappointment. The green beans, ironically, had more flavor than the main event. The drinks, however, were the redeeming quality of our meal.Overall, I'd say Founding Farmers - Washington needs to revisit their service strategy and rework their menu pricing. Until then, I'd recommend exploring other options in the area.",2
"We were seated quickly, despite not having a reservation, which was a pleasant surprise. The service was generally good. When we tried to adjust our order, requesting a large mac and cheese for the kids instead of two small portions, we learned that the orders go straight to the kitchen as soon as they're entered, which made any changes impossible.The first two kids' meals arrived surprisingly fast. We also ordered about four appetizers, which were all delicious--fried green tomatoes, blue cheese bacon dates, deviled eggs, and ahi tuna bites. For the main course, we ordered two farmhouse platters, while I opted for the herbed-crusted prime rib with mashed potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts.One of the farmhouse platters arrived first, and most of the group was served while the second platter and my prime rib were still MIA. By the time the last two plates finally showed up, five out of our seven guests had already finished their meals. That's when things started to go downhill.This is where it gets bizarre borderline diabolical. The prime rib was a huge disappointment. It was thin--about ¾ of an inch--and appeared to have been forgotten on the heated shelf for too long. What made it even worse was that someone had the strange idea to sear it. I can't even begin to understand why. The result was a tough, chewy prime rib that barely scored a 3/10. The Brussels sprouts were underwhelming, lacking the roasted flavor I had hoped for.The meal had been going well up until the long delays and the prime rib fiasco. And to top it off, the Au Jus was a coagulated mess.",2
"I was hoping the food at this location was better than the Georgetown location. Unfortunately, it's the same. The food isn't terrible, it's just ok. The worst part is the food isn't hot. I don't understand why they can't serve hot food. The au ju for the sandwich was room temp as indicated by the texture, it was gelatinous which is a good sign since you know it's not made from powder. The highlight was the service. Our server was really nice and attentive. Extra star was the service",2
"Founding Farmers seems to be known for being overpriced and pretty mid (and full of tourists) and unfortunately my visit last week confirmed that. They used to be known as a restaurant with a large menu that could accommodate almost any tastes, but that's sadly not the case anymore--when I first went six years ago there were many clearly labeled options on the menu for different diets, but this last time, ordering plant-based was a real struggle. No dish on the menu is plant-based as-is. Apparently even none of their breads are vegan, which struck me as really weird. I was the only vegan diner in my group but no one else was too impressed with their dishes either. Hope they reconsider their menu. The extra star here is for the staff, who seemed quite busy but tried to be accommodating and helpful despite the menu!",2
"Had just arrived in DC and was hungry so I went with some of my colleagues.  It was a great night in DC so we out outside but the service  and food were lacking.  WE ordered the ahi tuna bites, crab cakes and cracker crusted shrimp and had to sent the fries back because they were cold.  Not worthy of a return visit.",2
"Overrated ::clap, clap, clap, clap, clap:: I've been here probably a dozen of times over the years, but this is the first time I've come back in the last year and I regret it. Prices are sky high for food that's best described as ""meh,"" passable, or mediocre.  Example: Dry cheeseburger where the beef wasn't seasoned and the edges of the bacon weren't cooked. Another example: spinach dip that was separated, wet, and looked like a baby's spit up.  I could go on, but I won't.  Goodbye FF, I wish you well and hope you return to the quality you had years ago.",2
"Food: green tomatoes didn't come hot. They were a little difficult to cut and chew. Pot pie and pot roast were okay. Menu has a lot of variety. Service: Our waitress had an attitude. My husband is hard of hearing and when she had to repeat herself, she gave him a nasty look. Kind of ruined the experience. Ambiance: very busy and a little noisy. Bathrooms are clean and nice. Floors can be slippery so watch what shoes you wear. Interior is nice.",2
Tried this place for quick eats near our hotel. I got the scallops and risotto and the risotto was more like yellow rice mushy and overcooked- did not love. Everything didn't have much taste. Friend got the Steak Frites- the fries and bearnaise were good. Steak was tough. Overall was underwhelmed. The key lime pie was great tho,2
"Interesting menu, but the food was somewhat dull. Service was great to start, but got worse and surprisingly they rushed us out without offering dessert (at 9pm when they closed at 11pm)",2
"First time to this restaurant.
Ordered one of our favor dish traditional eggs Benedict. Just ok. Nothing special. The bread/biscuit is soft and flavorless.
Ordered a side of cheesy grits. Not cheesy at all. I tried to doctor the flavor. Not working! Grapefruit juice good.
Ordered a side of garlic spinach, delicious. Only thing I enjoyed.
The restaurant is very nice . Seating inside and outside. Our waitress was pleasant, professional",2
"So, as a previous vegetarian, I was obsessed with this place. However, as a vegan, my honest assessment is 1-2 stars for the food. I've come 2 more times as a vegan before adding this review, and the food has been horrible each time. How does this restaurant not know how to cook vegetables? Please don't ask what cook I want on my cauliflower steak.... Just cook it. A raw cauliflower steak is not ok, and when I'm saying ""make sure it's cooked.... Whatever that requires, medium well? Well?"" And you still bring it to me hard, then you're not even cooking to your ""temperatures."" My entire meal came out cold, and likewise, my green beans were nearly raw. I couldn't eat them, I left the entire portion on my plate. The only good thing about my meals on these two times was the spaghetti squash and marinara, which did come out warm and had a good flavor. I appreciate you having this option.
However, on our last time in, our server, Kate, is responsible for me adding this star, and she deserves 10 stars. Best server I've ever had actually, and she came to my table having already checked every single item and confirming it was vegan (aka, bringing the dessert menu and saying ""well I checked, but I'm sorry, none of our desserts are vegan."" Not surprised by this fact, but was highly impressed she even checked before I had to ask!). Overall, if eating the standard america diet or even vegetarian, this place is for you... and only you, which is so terribly disappointing.",2
"I used to love this place but its service has been worsened so much after pandemic. I'm local and regular. This is not the first or second, but third time in a row that experienced such bad service. This time I decide to write a review because it was just the worst.
I came here with my tourist friends who are non-native speakers. I could tell our server didn't check on us as frequently as other tables nearby and sometimes ignored us. He just asked ""everything good?"" then quickly moved to other tables. We ordered a soup and shrimp and grits which is like a soupy one. We didn't get spoons and the server never came back checking on us. I ended up going to a station and grab some spoons myself. When we asked for a check, he didn't even asked we want boxes.
Again, this is the third time in a row that I'm so disappointed by its service. I will probably never go back. And I will never recommend this place to tourists from other countries.",2
"Was nearby GWU and looking for some place to eat dinner without a wait. Was able to make an Open Table reservation for 15 minutes in the future. When I got there, there were people waiting outside for what looked like longer than 15 mins so they must not know how to use the internet. The host and waitress both seemed very friendly. I got the prime rib and it was very mediocre. The salt shakers did not work. Our server kind do forgot about us once we ordered. The wings were mediocre, tasted more like teriyaki wings than black garlic pepper. Took forever to get our bill and a box for the leftover wings. Very mediocre meal and slow service after the initial friendliness. Prices weren't cheap, especially considering the mediocre quality and taste.",2
"They were able to accommodate our request for outdoor seating in early November, which was nice. Service was pretty prompt despite being outside. They provided heaters to keep us warm.
The reason for my 2-star review is primarily my order of the prime rib dip. I will admit I ordered it without the sauce or the onions because I am a picky eater, but I was very unimpressed with the end result. The meat itself was very thin and dry, and there was very little cheese. However, my worst problem was the ""dip"" -- I don't know what was wrong with it but it was like a clear greasy animal fat jelly. It put me off my meal. My husband's burger was also quite underdone when he ordered it medium well.
The rest of our party enjoyed their meals and the fries are really good.",2
"So so so disappointing! I'm surprised that this restaurant continues to be popular despite the rip off in quality of food.
I'd been to Founding Farmers a few years back and didn't recall it being an extremely bad experience. I decided to try it again but unfortunately as vegetarians we were left disappointed.
They do have a whole meatless section and side dishes, but wow, the taste was barely anything and just cooked with no seasoning. We got the sides of French-Cut Green Beans (neither any flavor nor interesting texture whatsoever and a little undercooked). The Zucchini & Peas was the bare minimum in taste value.
For the veggie main options, quite a few could only be made using egg (e.g. the bread of the sandwich and bun of burger are made with egg). They couldn't even replace them with regular store quality bread or buns, which I would think is not too much to ask for. We ended up having a Salad, Cauliflower Steak, Veggie Cheeseburger, and Veggie Loaf. Funnily enough, after figuring out what we could have for a long time, the salad came with a bread on top. We easily removed it, but still that was funny.
I had the Cauliflower Steak. I'm not one to choose that dish often, but I thought they might give an interesting spin on it. I was so wrong. It came with the same tasteless green beans, tasteless mushroom risotto (I don't even remember really tasting mushroom) and really not memorable cauliflower. Everyone else didn't really thoroughly enjoy their dishes. Probably the Veggie Loaf was the most doable, but still the least that can be expected from this caliber of a restaurant.
For dessert, I got one of the few eggless options, which was the Chocolate Strawberries. I got the 5 for $10.99 option. The presentation was so bad lol, they were just placed on a plate, no effort, like if one were to haphazardly place them at home after they're just made. They were alright in taste, but for the price and reputation of the restaurant, extremely disappointing.
Given the long wait time, steep prices and the additional service charge for the sub-par quality in food, I would not recommend coming here, especially as vegetarians.
I increased the stars to two stars from one because my mom had left her phone in the restaurant and they put it in their safe, so we were able to pick it up the next day. Thank you!",2
"This is the epitome of ""could have been better"".
My niece raved about this place, so when we came into town to celebrate her graduating from law school, she picked this place. Said she loved the food, and she took care of reservations for seven.
Now, it's graduation season, and we know the place is going to be busy, but damn.
We got in and told one front desk person that we were all here. That person neglected to put into the system that we were all there, and thusly could be seated, so we stood around waiting for 10-15 until an employee asked if we had been helped. ""Oh! So sorry!""
We sit, put our orders in. My nephew gets a chicken salad, and asks for no avocado, no honey mustard, and ranch. My niece, the honoree, gets a stead, medium-well. I get the shrimp and crab risotto.
My nephew gets a chicken salad with avocado, a ton of honey mustard, and no ranch.
My niece gets steak frites, with medium rare steak.
I get clumps of moist rice with shrimp and crab meat in it.
Now, my nephew notes the error and gets the right salad. The waitress is very apologetic.
What happens over the next hour and change is a comedy of errors. My niece sends the steak back to get it to cook some more...and it never comes back. She asks about it, and it comes back at the right temperature, but now her fries are cold as hell. So they take the whole plate and come back with everything right. Meanwhile, everyone else is eating and she is..unhappy.
Like I said, comedy of errors. I have no doubt this place could be good. Their menu had some magical-sounding things. The management was polite and apologetic, the waitstaff very nice. But good lord was this a horrendous experience, and while she may be back, we as a family will not.",2
The best french toast I've ever had! Two stars because the floor at the exit was slippery and I fell on my knees but no one came to check or anything. Disappointed at the service.,2
The food is mediocre. My daughter's salad was missing two of the listed ingredients. Very busy and the waitstaff is friendly.,2
"Crazy crowded and loud. Decided it was too much and I would not enjoy it.
I decided to go to Tatte cafe. Had a great bowl of roasted eggplant, onion, tomatoes, spinach with a poached egg on top.",2
"After a wonderful first experience at the DC location, I returned with my family, only this time to the Foggy Bottom site. I was terribly disappointed. The service was slow and we felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff and food runners.
Starting with the drinks, my wife's Aperol Spritz was flat, requiring a remake. That's normally not a problem, except that it wasn't remade until 1/2 through dinner...it was ordered when we were seated.
The food tasted great, however when it was brought out, they left my burger sitting on the expo line. By the time I finally got my food, the rare burger had been cooked medium well, the bun was dry and the fry's were not eatable. Moreover, we never had a two bite food quality check. That would have pointed out that the food drop was incomplete. Finally, the food runners actually ran away. I tried to ask for an extra plate for my 4 year old daughter, but was left feeling silly for speaking to myself.
The vibe in the restaurant was nice. It wasn't too busy, there were completely empty tables around us. That's what makes this experience disappointing. The food saved lunch, but the service was terrible. They never even cleared our table. We had a stack of dirty plates as we ate and we needed extra napkins, but we could never ask for them.
The service was not what I expected, we all felt as if we were an inconvenience. I'm disappointed. I gave 2 starts because my drink was nice and everyone else was content with the food...we hoped for thrilled, not content.",2
"I hate writing bad reviews and usually will not do it at all unless I feel that strongly about an institution.
Was visiting the DC area and wanted a good breakfast. Ordered the founding farmers breakfast with eggs, steak & hash browns. Eggs were great. Hash browns were alright. But the steak....oh my gosh.
I ordered my steak medium. Came out closer to medium rare; super bloody & I could barely cut through the piece of meat. Ended up telling the server, she said the kitchen would fire up another one. Got ANOTHER steak...same issue. And it was unreal. I understand maybe just messing up once. But...twice? The seasoning/marinade smelled and tasted AMAZING, all I wanted was to enjoy the steak.
The manager or whoever was in charge stopped by to see how everything was & asked if they could do anything. At that point, after 2 undercooked steaks..I just wanted to pay and leave. For an establishment that's reviewed well SO highly, I had much much MUCH higher expectations.
My friend and I also got the beignets & the inside was SPONGY. She was in NOLA and had real beignets, and I doubt that spongy is the texture anyone is going for. Also ordered French toast & those were underwhelming too.
I had high hopes for this spot because of raving reviews but I was beyond disappointed. I definitely don't recommend this spot for breakfast.",2
"I hate to write this as I have previously had a positive experience at the Pennsylvania Ave NW location but when i revisted on 3/8/24 I had friends in town and our reservation, meal, & my follow up message to mgmt have all been handled so poorly. We were very late being seated for our 7P reservation, it even looked as if others arriving after us were seated before us. Perhaps they were more persistent, but we had a reservation, we shouldn't have to be aggressive about being seated.
It took a while for our food to arrive & based on the temp, it had likely been sitting in the window. My fried platter of fries, shrimp, crabcake & fish was room temperature at best. I reported these things through their company website. It's been weeks without a response from mgmt. It's not cheap to dine out and we were a party of 5. The ball was dropped several times. We did not get what we paid for.",2
"I was excited to try this place out, since we had already tried to get in before and it was too busy. But honestly I was very disappointed. The service was slow, the prices were high, and the food was bland.
I got the Seven Cheese Macaroni (plus the chicken tenders on top, which was an extra $6 for only 3 medium strips of chicken) and my wife got the Straw and Hay Bucatini. Neither of us really liked our meals. The macaroni and cheese was completely tasteless and bland, and my wife had the same complaint about her bucatini.
Not to mention, there is a 5% ""Restaurant Recovery Charge"" that is automatically added to every ticket. Their reasoning for this is ""to cover pandemic-related losses and debts"". I understand it was hard to survive as a restaurant during Covid, but that was 3 years ago, there is absolutely no reason to continue to charge more. If you can't survive as a business without this recovery charge, then add it to your overall food prices instead of hiding it as an additional charge (their prices are already extravagant, $6 for 3 pieces of chicken added on top of a bland $19 Mac and Cheese? Really?). For me, this reason alone was enough to justify never coming back.
There was one positive, however, the bathrooms were extremely clean.",2
"No a DC local, but was recommended this place by a friend. Unfortunately, it does not live up the it's rating on Yelp.
Food:
The chicken pot pie was decent. The biscuit on top was flaky and paired well with the cream pie filling. However, the filling was a bit sweet for my liking.
The chicken fried steak was a huge mis-steak. Usually fried steak is dry, but this was a whole drought. On top of that the batter around the steak was not adhesive and fell off with the slightest touch. Worst of all, the steak was not seasoned at all, while the batter that fell off was overly salty.
The side of fries were inconsistent, some fries were perfectly golden brown, while others were soggy. This most likely means the fries were sitting under a heat lamp for some time.
Drink:
We got a pint of Victory Golden Monkey. The flavors were great, but it came in a very sad plastic kids cup like the ones you found in 1980's pizza joint.
Service:
The service was one of the redeeming factors. Our service was very gracious and checked up on our table often to refill our waters.",2
"I have been to Founding Farmers before and enjoyed it so when I was back in the city decided to check it out again; unfortunately this time the experience wasn't as great.we ordered the bried and bread to start off then we got the grilled cheese plus tomato soup with roasted veggies and the beef sandwich with farro salad.  everything came out together even though we ordered the bread first.  the bread and cheese were good but not worth the price they charged.  out of the other food, the grilled veggies were really good, the farro salad was not good, the tomato soup wasn't really a soup and the beef sandwich was average.  overall poor quality food and bad customer service",3
"we had heard good things about founding farmers so decided to check it out.  we started off with bread, crisps and dips which came with really nice chips, average bread and ok crisps.  the dips were onion, pimento, avocado and another kind - some were decent others good.  we then got the veggie burger with the cornbread stuffing, the avocado toast and the veggie and brie sandwich with mashed potatoes.  the mashed potatoes and cornbread stuffing were excellent, the sandwich was decent and the burger and avocado toast were not goodoverall nice ambiance and decent food",3
"Founding Farmers offers a classic American dining experience, but unfortunately, it didn't fully deliver in terms of service or some dishes.SERVICE - The service started off poorly with the hostess, who was noticeably standoffish and rude. She didn't make eye contact and seemed to disregard our presence entirely. Thankfully, our waiter was kind and friendly, which helped redeem the experience a bit.FOODDeviled Eggs - This was a miss for me. The texture was off, with a crunchy element (likely celery) that didn't belong. The flavor itself lacked depth, and somehow, even the egg flavor got lost. It just didn't come together well.Crazy Corn Chicken Salad - While the salad itself was flavorful, the kettle corn didn't quite work. It felt out of place and didn't pair well with the rest of the dish. I'd skip that next time.Farmhouse Platter - The fried chicken had great flavor but was a bit dry. The BBQ ribs were tough and didn't fall off the bone as expected. The baby cheeseburgers were fine--nothing special. However, the street corn and slaw were both refreshing and a highlight of the dish.Butternut Squash Ravioli - The ravioli was a bit too soft for my taste. I prefer pasta to be more al dente. However, the flavor was a nice balance of sweet and savory, which made it enjoyable overall.Lemon Garlic Broccoli - This was the surprise standout of the meal. The flavor was fantastic--so good that I usually don't pay much attention to my broccoli, but I finished this quickly. Definitely worth ordering as your veggie.While Founding Farmers has some great dishes, there were a few misses, especially with service and certain food items. The atmosphere was decent, but the service hiccups and inconsistent food left me wishing for a more polished experience. I'd still give it another try, but I'm not sure it will be my first choice next time.",3
"We made reservations for 8:45am but the sign said they opened at 9:00am. Luckily, they did in fact open at 8:45am. People were already standing outside waiting! Ethan was our waiter and he was really great. Fast and friendly!Beignets - I've never had a beignet before so I have nothing to compare them. Regardless, these were delicious! Came out hot and fresh. They were soft, moist and flaky. It reminded me of a donut/funnel cake/croissant. My fiancé loved these. He was already full from his entree but couldn't leave without finishing the beignets. Chicken and Waffles - The chicken was a lot better than from our dinner last night at Central Michel. Nicely battered and moist. Waffle was huge and fluffy. The gravy on the side was a nice touch. Roasted Veggie Scramble w/ Chicken Sausage - This came with your choice of a side and bread. I went with the hash browns and multigrain toast. Scramble but good but nothing mind blowing. Something you could throw together at home. Hash browns were generic as well as their toast.Overalls, solid breakfast place. Definitely get the beignets when you come!",3
"I was so excited to head back to Founding Farmers after some time and unfortunately, it left me feeling a little disappointed. We had 6pm reservations, arrived early but were not seated until 6:20pm. Our server was friendly and nice but the poor girl got double sat and we knew she was going to be running. They have the tables all packed in there. All we could hear was the conversation right next to us. Not the best place for a date night. Our drinks took a long time coming from the bar. The highlight was the prosciutto bread. My meal was not that great. The server misheard me and I got what I didn't order. I didn't say anything cause honestly, I just didn't care to be bothered. My husband's steak was alright. Nothing too great. With other amazing places in the city, this place ranked last on all our meals this trip.",3
"Another great visit! This is a must visit anytime we are in DC. This trip did not disappoint. We ordered the deviled eggs and pickled vegetables for our starters. Both are our favorites! Simple but flavorful. I opted for the chicken and waffles, which is a first for me! I was pleasantly surprised at how good the two together can be! The mac and cheese side is amazingly good and I will definitely order just that next time. I'd also like to try the cornbread too. The chicken was fried perfectly. Crispy and not oily. It had a lot of flavor. The chicken gravy side was quite tasty too. The waffles were good but became super soggy after a while. I also ordered the seasonal escabeche which I was super excited about (Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, carrots and onions) but it was a dud. My bowl was nothing but carrots! My daughter ordered the same thing and she had a good mix of all the veggies. Other entrees ordered were the rice and bean burger with smoked tofu and the seasonal chili (beef, veggies and bacon). Both dishes were delicious and enjoyed! We finished our meal off with the triple layer chocolate mousse cake which was rich and decadent. Perfect end to our meal!",3

Had really high hopes for Founding Farmers with all the positive reviews. Made a reservation on Open Table. The place was packed but service was good. Let me start with the food. I ordered the prime rib and it was served cold. That was really disappointing The mushroom gnocchi was just okay. Not too much flavor was more on the bland side.. The corn bread was probably my favorite thing we ordered. The service and vibe was good. I was let down by the food.,3
"I wanted to love this restaurant, but it fell short. I really wish that when serving hot chocolate with whipped cream on top these restaurants would make sure they are starting with really hot cocoa because when it gets to the table it is already cold. If I wanted chocolate milk, I would have ordered that instead. My husband barely touched his $6 cup of cocoa. He did enjoy the beignets, which were light, fluffy and plentiful. The ham on my Benedict was dried out and the hollandaise had an unexpected kick to it, which was off-putting since I am not a fan of spicy foods. Perhaps they overdid it with the cayenne pepper. Hash browns were good. I might give it another try, when in the area, as omelettes looked very good.",3
"Service could've been a little better and the food was just ok on this visit. My first visit was amazing, but my second visit left more to be desired. Will possibly try it again, as maybe it wasn't a good day for the chef.",3
"We stopped in for lunch after visiting the WhiteHouse. The restaurant had a lively vibe and the bathrooms were nice and clean. Our server was great and gave recommendations of what to get since the menu can be overwhelming. My daughter had the spatchcock chicken, hubs had the fried chicken, I had the pastrami melt, and my son the baby cheeseburgers (3). Note that they offer canned sodas or house made sodas which we tried, and no refills. Overall the food was good but not something that wowed me. For a solid lunch this place will fit the bill. My pastrami melt could've been better as it seemed more like a sandwich with toasted bread and tons of slaw. My brussel sprouts were a bit al dente for my liking and needed more seasoning. Solid lunch spot.",3
"A long queue to enter this popular restaurant made me want to check it out for breakfast. One word comes to mind - ""Meh"". Albeit, o no the positive side of 'meh'. The chicken and waffles were good. The fluffiest waffle I ever had!  I liked the opportunity to sit outside as well.  So why only three stars. It has that chain restaurant feeling. The staff work really hard, but there simply not enough of them. Then again, it is Labor Day, so maybe they were short staffed. I don't think I'll be coming here again. It's not a bad place, just not my cup of tea.",3
This restaurant can be hot or miss. I've come to prefer the Tyson's outlet over dc. Ordered scallops and they were very overcooked and dry alongside a less than creamy risotto. Frustrating when the meal has such potential that is missed by rushed kitchen staff not paying attention to the menu. Date had the chicken and waffles which he enjoyed but nothing to write home about. Restaurant was busy and we were seated close to our reservation time. Staff was nice enough but I didn't feel like anyone provided outstanding long service but moreover just checking the boxes as they milled about.,3
"I stopped by Founding Farmers on my way to the airport for a quick brunch. My coworkers and I were traveling with luggage, so of course we were looking a little clunky. When we walked in, the hostess asked if we wanted to put our luggage to the side of the entrance, so we did. While doing this, we noticed another worker, standing next to the podium, was just staring at us. And it wasn't a friendly stare either... we felt uncomfortable. Moving on, we sat down and looked at the menu to order. Here's what I had:Aztec Latte - this latte is unique in that it uses cayenne in the drink. As a result, it's spicy. The heat is enough to coat the back of your throat and give you a warming sensation. I liked it because I can handle my heat, but if you can't then I recommend getting the chai latte instead. If ordering this drink, have a glass of water on the side so you can have something more refreshing to cleanse your palate while eating! Breakfast Chicken & Waffles - I was a bit disappointed with this dish, with my main disappointment being the chicken and waffles. The chicken portion felt small, but most importantly (to me) it was not as crunchy as I was expecting. The fried portion was soggy. The waffles have a different texture; it's crispy, but very airy and light, though lacked flavor on its own. It tasted good, but didn't necessarily wow me. The waffles gave me Eggo cinnamon french toast stick vibes. Normally I would like to add maple syrup to this dish, but the maple syrup they have on the side has cinnamon sticks in it, which I didn't want the cinnamon flavor on a savory dish. I would come back to try other dishes for future opportunities, but unfortunately it would be difficult since I was only visiting for a few days. We didn't have a good experience with the worker staring at us prior to seating, but the server who served us was nice and friendly. Overall, my experience was okay.",3
"We dined outside. Very very busy.
Staff were attentive and helpful.
The food was decent. Price was steep. 5 plates plus dessert around $230 not including tip. No kids menu.
Waffles was delicious. Had a cinnamon taste - don't think I got a pic but basic Belgian type waffle.
The beef short rib, mashed potatoes and roasted autumn veggies with apple glaze delightful. Would return specifically for this dish.
Chicken enchiladas were decent. The steak that accompanied not so good.
Green beans were terrible just blanched .
Dessert was also a miss.",3
"The service was friendly and patient.
Today's Rickey was a great non alcoholic drink.
The flavor of the chicken pot pie was good but the overall dish wasn't what I expected. The ratio of bread to filling (chicken, veggies) and was way off. It was a lot of bread and not enough chicken. The bread is more croissant-like rather than pie-like.
The dark chocolate caramel cookie was fantastic, not too sweet, and good quality chocolate.",3
"This place has really gone downhill. I always loved the vibe and ambiance as I've dined often for business meetings for many years. Not only did they charge me for an appetizer I didn't receive, but I was told marketing would be in touch for a make good due to poor service (our server didn't even check in on us), inaccurate billing and food that arrived late and cold! Never heard from them. Eek! Below is a picture of my chicken and waffles and super bland dessert. The portions are much smaller than they were in the past. DC has countless better dinner options. Just no!",3
"Let me start off by saying, the food was good however I was expecting more because a lot of people gave this place 5 star reviews. We chose this place based on the high Yelp reviews and although our experience wasn't bad, there was nothing we ate that deserved 5 stars. Nonetheless, we were seated quickly and our server, Byron, was courteous and helpful. The ambiance was welcoming, I even saw I guy walk in with two dogs.
We ordered Scratch sodas (Vanilla and ginger) and the Farmer Girl(?) to drink. My friend raved about the Scratch ginger soda but the vanilla not so much. For appetizers we had Brie toast and artichoke dip, both were good. As for meals, we had a veggie burger, chicken and waffles, fried chicken and mash potatoes and a soup and salad.
All of our reviews averaged 3 stars. The veggie burger and chicken and waffles were crowd pleasers and the rest was mid.
I did like that they offer homemade chocolates on their dessert menu.",3
"Add this place to the list of tourist traps dedicated to our founding fathers.
Every single person I talked to recommended this place and it was good not great.
The place was a very cute brunch spot and service was incredible and behind friendly. I just wish the food were as good as the people bringing it to you.",3
"SO packed with people - over an hour wait for a table, so we opted to sit at the bar. The service received was great, Luan was our bartender/server and was fantastic. The food was delicious in taste and good in portion, BUT vegetables on both dishes were severely undercooked- essentially raw! My husband has dietary restrictions due to an illness and cannot eat raw veggies, so he had to leave them and of course remained hungry. We also ordered cornbread on a skillet, but my husband was also unable to eat it, as it had whole corn kernels in it (never seen this). The whole kernels were not mentioned on the menu either.",3
"We had reservations for brunch in a Saturday and sat outside. The inside of the restaurant was crowded but the hostess was efficient and friendly and they sat parties fairly quickly. They seem well versed in dealing with a high volume of patrons and that was pretty impressive.
The food and service , unfortunately, was lacking. Our server was friendly, but the food was not hot when it finally came out and we had to ask for everything separately (hot sauce, ketchup, napkins, salt and pepper ...none of that was at the table or brought with our savory breakfasts. Tea came out late as did our juice. The food was just okay - nothing spectacular about any of it and it was pretty expensive for the amount of food that came with each order.
At over 17,000 reviews, I expected much more from Founding Farmers. Perhaps the sweeter breakfasts (French toast, pancakes etc.) are better than the eggs and omelets, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back and try.",3
"We made a reservation online for the Founding Farmers because the restaurant is always busy.
When we arrived we waited about 10 minutes but the restaurant was packed.
Service was slow, coffee was average it had a bad after taste.
When the food finally arrived I was kind of disappointed. My biscuits were hard on the top, and I wanted my hash browns well done and they weren't. I was amazed how they make their grits. At first I thought corn was in the grits but it wasn't corn - the grits were extremely lumpy.
The experience was average - maybe I ordered the wrong thing - I'm not sure. If I go back I will order something different and definitely stay away from the grits.",3
"There is street metered parking or a paid parking garage. The decor is more modern with a bar and 2 levels of seating. We were seated quickly, the service to take our order was quick. The hashbrowns needed more of a crunch to them, the sausage was okay, the jam was really good but overall the breakfast was just okay. I tried the hollandaise sauce and it was too much mayo for me.",3
"We came here for brunch and overall it was ok. Although the staff was friendly, they didn't really seem on top of things. First of all, our food took over 30 minutes to order. Also, we didn't have utensils and basically had to ask for them. My utensils were super hot, probably because they had just come out of the dishwasher. I also had to separately ask for a spoon since I got a yogurt bowl. The food itself was very mediocre. We got a yogurt bowl, eggs and toast, and chicken and waffles. The yogurt bowl was ok, but could have at least been chilled. I also got a blueberry muffin, and although fresh out the oven, could have been better. The eggs were ok, but the bread had an odd texture. It felt like it was reheated in the microwave or something. Also the chicken and waffles came with a big waffle, but one small piece of chicken.",3
"Good but not great food. I was not wow'ed by the pot pie or the brussel sprouts side. However, super friendly and efficient service behind the bar. I'm sure they have many more delicious options on the menu but I honestly wasn't impressed by the flavor combinations, sauces, or ingredients from what I read. Definitely more of a traditional rather than modern American restaurant. Not a MUST go when in DC.",3
Comfort foodGood serviceSome interesting itemsHad spatchcock chicken and fresh fish which was Wallyu,4
"Located across from the Western Market that is connected to 2000 Penn where I was working with my business team, my boss chose Founding Farmers because it was convenient and easy walking distance. It just so happened it was also part of a restaurant chain that we had ate the night before at their Georgetown location. Why my boss wanted to eat at their same restaurant two days in a row really is beyond me, but I will say we had the opportunity to enjoy lunch in a different setting, ordering different food. So the experience was different but still consistent.We enjoyed fried green tomatoes and candied bacon sticks for appetizers while I had a fried chicken salad for my main course. Overall, it was solid. It was filling the meal and satisfied without needing to order anything else. The service was on point in an interior that was very city comfort food and bar vibes. Dark gray interiors, warm, dark wood trim, the bar certainly had a happy hour and caters to the nearby business, government, and academic crowd that is dependable.",4
"I came with a very large group of people on NYE and our server Abby was so on top of it. Despite the big party, everything went really smoothly. Took off a star because I ordered scallops and they were super over cooked. Drinks are ok. Overall, food/drink is solid and good for pleasing a group but nothing to write home about.",4
"This is a review for brunch here. I came with a large group, and I give mad props to the waitress for handling it so well. In addition, the food here was so good. I ordered the basic breakfast. I'm kind of obsessed with the hashbrowns.  love hashbrowns as it is, and these are particularly flavorful. I'd eat them every morning if I could. This place also takes the refreshing step of seasoning eggs so that they are every bit as good as the more complex things on the plate. I'm not sure what they put on the bread, but I loved it. The only thing I didn't love on the plate was the bacon, which was pretty salty.",4
"Stopped by with some friends for their brunch buffet but it's only offered on Sundays I believe. The group I was with raved about this spot so I was excited to try it. The food was okay, I got the burger and onion rings. The burger was just fine, onion rings were honestly not good at all. They accidentally brought me fries with my burger and honestly glad they did because those made up for the onion rings. The wings and biscuits were my absolute favorite part of the meal. If nothing else, you must get the wings as an app! The sodas are made in house which is a cool concept but for the price and no refill I passed on trying them. The service was spotty but overall okay. Will be back to checkout brunch and give them another try.",4
"I'm going to be super honest and say while this place is worth the hype I felt that there were a few details where they fell short of the 5 star experience. Most of the food was next level: The biscuit app and ravioli entree were sooooo good.  I would definitely order those again!n We also  enjoyed  the brie app and while I didn't try the chicken and waffles it looked a really good before my kid inhaled it. Unfortunately the vegetarian loaf (tasteless) and burgers (greasy) were not very good so I suggest skipping those. Our server was really helpful and mostly attentive not sure why we weren't offered dessert, instead our check was dropped and we ended ordering dessert AFTER we paid. Lastly while the restaurant itself is pretty loud our table itself was pretty awful.  We sat right near the drink well and had to listen to all the banging and shaking along with the bartenders chatting about their personal stuff. This was also the server hang out while they stood around waiting for drinks.  This is  not what you expect when you have a reservation.",4
"I've been here a few times but this time took part in happy hour!! My friend and I had great service even though the bar was packed. FYI HH is only at the bar. Loved the Constitution!! Would definitely get again!I ordered the skillet corn bread which I really enjoy because it has pieces of corn in it and comes with honey butter! Yummm. A lady who sat right next to us and became friends quite quickly had the tuna tacos which were delicious!!  My friend who I came with got the prosciutto jam bread which was also yummy!For dinner my friend got the fried chicken and I got the sausage, mushroom, and ricotta gnocchi, which was good just a smaller portion than what I was expecting.Too full for dessert and eager to see Ellen DeGeneres!",4
"This place seems to have as many visitors as the local monuments. We were visiting DC and had to stop by for dinner. It was really hard to choose from all the options on the menu but you can't go wrong with fried chicken. I was hesitant because I wasn't a fan of the sides but we were told that we can make any swaps! I went for the Mac and cheese instead of collard greens. The fried chicken was a really good meal, the mashed potatoes were surprisingly my favorite and I'm usually not a fan. I would try to balance out the sides though, since the meal is very heavy. Overall the entire meal portion was ginormous and easily could be shared between 2 people. We also tried the butternut squash ravioli and that was good but didn't stand out. We also got the fried green tomatoes for starters and they made for a nice savory appetizer. But since they're fried they can be too filling if not shared. Lastly what I loved about this place is that they had little pre packaged founding farmers chocolate boxes for $12 that made the best gifts to take back home.",4
"Great service and delicious food. I sat at the bar but they have great outdoor seating too.Food was fresh and I had their dinner but wanted to try breakfast.Sausage wasn't for me, I asked for chicken but I think it was wrong but the juice was fresh so definitely get that.Bar service was quick but if it wasn't so hot I'd be outside.",4
"We just arrived in DC and after checking into our hotel headed out to eat.  We had used Yelp before we arrived to find local restaurants that sounded interesting, and one was the Founding Farmers, just a couple of blocks away.  Walking in we found a loud vibrant place.  It was getting late so it wasn't as busy as other reviews describe.  We opted to sit inside on a warm evening and had only a 15 minute wait.  There were tables outside available immediately.There are several menu items I could have picked, I decided on their Yankee Pot Roast.  While it was a good dish, I found the pot roast itself was far from fork tender.  The star for me was my summer crop side, their Roasted Heirloom Carrots.  With their orange glaze I found them exceptionally good.I also remembered they offered homemade pies and talked my family into getting a slice of Coconut Cream Pie.  I think we were all too full so one large slice was plenty and a sweet ending to a nice meal.",4
"It sounds like you had a pleasant dining experience with us, Art!  Thank you for sharing your experience, and we hope you have a wonderful time exploring more of DC! -Tiffany",4
"Founding Farmers: Where the Fried Chicken Works Magic. I'm convinced there's a secret ingredient in their fried chicken batter - it's simply the best I've ever tasted! We loved it so much, we dined here twice during our three-day trip to DC, once for dinner and again for brunch.On Tuesday evening, the atmosphere was electric, with a lively crowd eagerly awaiting their tables. The scene reminded me of concert-goers lining up before a show. A helpful tip for those without reservations: try booking through OpenTable. We snagged a table within 15 minutes, while others waited in line for 45 minutes or more.During our dinner visit, we enjoyed the well-priced cocktails, the delicious (though slightly tame) skillet cornbread, and the Founder's platter, which offered a delightful sampler of their most popular dishes. The star of the show, however, was undoubtedly the fried chicken.Our brunch experience was equally satisfying, featuring the must-try chicken and waffles, a crispy fried chicken salad, and a hearty breakfast plate. Every dish we ordered was flavorful and well-prepared.The only minor hiccup was the service. On both occasions, I had to remind the staff about my request for hot sauce, which arrived towards the end of our meal. Despite this small issue, our overall experience was fantastic",4
"I've been to this spot a couple of times and I enjoyed my experiences.
I was recently here for lunch and had the Kale Salad with Grilled Chicken. It was a good sized portion for lunch. The dressing was flavorful- I just asked for a light serving and that was perfect. I also had the Cornbread Skillet and that was a nice accompaniment to the salad. The cornbread had good corn flavor and texture and the nondairy honey butter was still pretty good - this is a great dish to share with the table.
The service has always been friendly.
This restaurant is a good option for families and large groups since the menus have so much variety.",4
"This is a fantastic brunch spot in DC! The presentation of each dish is beautifully done, adding to the overall experience. I had the Founding Farmers breakfast, which comes with two eggs, a choice of meat, a side, and bread. I opted for the chicken and waffles with an egg, and it was absolutely delicious--especially with the white gravy on the side. Highly recommend this place for a great meal!",4
"Had a nice breakfast here! They had a nice long table for our large group. The menu has lots of tasty sounding options, though I decided to go for something simple and light. I got the avocado toast and egg whites which was very tasty even with how simple it is. Also ordered a chai latte which was very flavorful.",4
"I decided to have dinner with the family at Founding Farmers after reading the reviews. First of all it's best to make a reservation or you could be waiting awhile +/- 30 minutes. The decor of the restaurant is gorgeous and the lay out flows very well throughout the restaurant. They do have outdoor seating as well as bar seating for dining. The customer service from beginning to end was very good and waiter did a great job taking care of us.
I ordered the Chicken and Waffle which seemed to be the best option considering that everything is ""made from scratch"" and they say their fried chicken is award winning. Let me get straight to the point, the chicken was good, tasty and crispy but it didn't have the soul food taste to it as you'd expect with chicken and waffles. I was disappointed but not every chicken and waffle dish is going to be great.
The macaroni and cheese as a side was good but not delicious, the green beans were bland and I needed to add salt and more salt to give it some semblance of flavor. Again, don't expect this to be a soul food experience and if that's not what you're looking for then you'll be fine.
My daughter had the cheeseburger and she said it was good but she wasn't impressed. My wife had the baby cheeseburgers and she said they were good. Overall, we had a great experience but the food was not the star of the evening.",4
"While visiting in DC I heard great things about this restaurant and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did! Let me start off by saying.... I went on a Tuesday evening and it was packed! I did not have reservations so my wait was about 2 hours. People with reservations had a slight wait as well. I highly recommend making reservations before you go.
The staff/waiter was nice and friendly and recommended a few dishes. I got the garlic wings and biscuits as an appetizer AMAZING! Everyone was ordering the cornbread skillet so I wanted to try it but our order never came out (oversight on their behalf... maybe next time). As my main dish, I ordered the steak and enchiladas. The skirt steak with chimichurri sauce was excellent along with the street corn. I didn't really care for the chicken enchiladas (chick was a bit dry). My friend ordered the ribeye with mash potatoes and asparagus... she loved it! To top off our meal we got red wine and a margarita. The drinks were delicious.
I highly recommend this place. You will not be disappointed. A lot of items looked really good so I plan on going back once more before my trip ends so I can try something else and have another yummy margarita to go with my dinner.",4
Service was great! Homemade sodas were amazing! We shared the fried green tomatoes and the Turkey BLT! All was very yummy!,4
"We dined here and could tell it was a popular place. It was loud and bustling but in a good city restaurant way. The food is all made in house or sorted locally. We loved the Crab and Artichoke Cheese Dip for an appetizer.
For entrees we got the Pot Roast as well as the Shrimp and Grits. The Pot Roast was good but not amazing. The onions, carrots and celery were as if they just cut it raw and threw it in before serving. I like a veggie that has a crisp when cooked but these tasted raw. It was also overall just lukewarm. Flavor was good though. The Shrimp and Grits came out piping hot and was flavorful though should be called Shrimp Gumbo as it was served with what felt like a tablespoon of Grits.
We did enjoy it overall and they do have an expansive menu that would be worth trying again.",4
"This location of Founding Farmers in downtown DC will always have sentimental value to me, since it was a regular haunt when I worked in the area back in the late-2000s as it was the site of many get togethers with professional colleagues and friends alike. And TBH, it's hard to believe that 2024 will mark the 16th year of operation!
After walking in past the revolving door, the small-ish waiting area is often cramped with folks waiting to be seated by the patient staff. The mostly dark color palette is accentuated by lighter hardwood floors, furniture, and tiles. Kudos to the management team for maintaining these public areas in good condition.
While I'm no longer attending Happy Hour gatherings, I do enjoy popping by the OG location for of all things, dessert! A friend and I came here after a performance at the Kennedy Center and were lucky enough to snag a table upstairs. Just my preference, but if given the choice, I will usually opt to sit upstairs since it's a bit quieter and there are fewer ""acoustic challenges"" as found in the downstairs dining area.
Our server recommended the Butterscotch Bread pudding to share...and it was an excellent choice indeed! A portion large enough for 2-3 people arrived with the top of the dish toasty and crumbly. Digging in, the bread was moist and had an amazing butterscotch flavor with hints of cinnamon and light sugar. Dunk a piece into the smooth vanilla sauce, and it's the perfect pairing.
All desserts are made in-house, and the quality is reflected in the finished product. If I'm downtown and want something to satisfy my sweet tooth, you won't go wrong with this place.
16,000+ reviews and counting for the original Founding Farmers location which started it all.",4
"Came last night for a late dinner with family. Balsamic blue bacon cheeseburger, shrimp and sun dried tomato pasta, turkey avocado blt and the shrimp and grits were our entrees. All very good but I believe that our server was a little slow on picking them up as all were not temperature hot but relatively warm. (Shrimp and grits sauce had congealed on the top).
All were delicious just wish they were warmer. Of note. Their spicy Paloma and FROZEN gin and tonic were great.",4
"Besides the service being pretty slow for lunch on a week day. The restaurant was not very crowded for its size and there were plenty of staff working that day, so no reason for slow service, but once we started getting taken care of there were no real complaints. Inside there is seating upstairs and downstairs, We were upstairs and I'm sure if we had a window seat there would be some decent views of surrounding buildings or maybe even a monument. One thing I also really enjoyed about this visit was the music that was playing, It was the perfect mix of good feeling upbeat music. * If you know the playlist please drop a compliment* lol
For food and drinks we both ordered iced coffees with oat milk. They offer flavors if you want, just no hazelnut which is my go to. Not a deal breaker, but it would have been nice. I'm here on a work trip from Charleston SC, so when I'am home and see shrimp and grits on the menu, that is an easy go to for me. After Ordering that here I think I will keep that for exclusively when I am down south. It wasn't bad, but surely wasn't great. I can't remember exactly what the sandwich was that my friend had ordered, but she had no complaints.
All in all great spot to meet work friends in the area for a bite to eat, there is also a full bar so im sure this is a popular spot for locals after work as well.",4
"I'm in town for a conference and saw this place had over 17,000 reviews. I GOTTA try it. We were greeted by a super nice gentlemen at the entrance and taken upstairs for breakfast. I had the eggs, bacon and seasoned tomatoes and upgraded my meal with the French toast. The crisp on the French toast was unreal. I almost felt fried, but it was so lite on the inside. The syrup is amazing and had a slight cinnamon flavor. The ambiance is awesome, very cute decor, good music volume, and friendly staff. If you're in the area... stop by!",4
"I was recommended this place off of social media. I was super excited to try it out as I've never been before. I had spent the day in the National Mall so it was a relatively short walk to get here from the White House. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered our drinks. We ordered a pork chop with Brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes and broccoli to share. The pork chop was succulent and juicy. The mashed potatoes were very creamy. The Brussels sprouts were AMAZING! So amazing we had to order an extra side of them. However, the broccoli was much to be desired. They were covered in some kind of sauce (?) that basically made them inedible. The flavor was not good and we ended up not finishing the dish. We were a bit surprised because when we ordered the extra side of Brussels sprouts it was the same amount of food as the broccoli side but cost double. We had supposedly ordered the ""large"" size but it looked more like the small. Overall we had decent service and the food was very good (minus the broccoli). The location inside was very cute and the bathroom was relatively clean. My only complaint about the bathroom was that they had no hand towels and only a hand dryer.",4
"Very good crab, the poached egg was closer to hard boiled. Hash browns were fine, not memorable.
French toast was dry in the middle. The cinnamon infused syrup on the table was very thin...not even really maple syrup. Still tasty.
Coffee and hot cocoa were not hot. Bloody Mary was okay but not great.
Service was great. Friendly and prompt. The place is cute and clean.
Over $100 including the wellness fee... Overall a decent experience, but not one to go out of our way for.",4
"Absolutely love how they source ingredients from family-farmed and local distributors and how everything is made in-house from scratch! For a starter, I tried their chicken dumplings. They were okay. I found the skin of the dumpling to be a bit thick and the filling to be a bit dense, but I loved the sauce they came in. For my main course, I enjoyed avocado poblano cheeseburger. It was a perfect medium rare, and it just felt so light with all the veggies included. The fries on the side were delicious too! Nothing to write home about, but a solid pairing with a solid burger. I split one of their vanilla cream-filled cronuts for dessert, and it was good but not what I'd expect from a good cronut. It was a bit too chewy and dense, and almost stale considering it was the end of the day. I could appreciate the layers, but the texture and consistency was more reminiscent of a stale Ozzie roll from the Great American Restaurants chain. Overall, a nice spot with an extensive menu and a wonderful mission statement.",4
"AMAZING!! literally everything was a 10/10. We started with the deviled eggs and cocktails, and had the Squash ravioli, veggie loaf, ribeye, and side of the sweet potato and marshmallow fluff for dinner. For dessert, we had the VA peanut butter moose pie.. wow just wow. We also took home the candy bar collection- tastes just like the OG candies, but made with clean ingredients  Our server, Byron, was amazing! He was attentive and kind, and answered all questions! This is the first review I have ever left on yelp.. all to say it is 100% worth it- GO NOW!!!",5
"Wow, thank you for such an incredible review, Carsyn! We are happy you enjoyed every part of your dining experience. Byron will be thrilled to hear your kind words! We’re honored to be your first Yelp review and look forward to welcoming you back soon! -Jessica",5
Food was incredible and the setting was inviting. Our server Ashley made the night memorable and most enjoyable,5
"Jose was AMAZING! He was very attentive to our table and helped us choose what to get! I love this restaurant so much - truly might be my favorite ever! It's so fresh, delicious and YUMMY! The ambiance was perfect - everyone was so friendly and welcoming! 10/10 coming back (this was my second time this week!!)",5
"My friend had been bragging on how good this place was and I finally got to experience it.The staff were amazing. We didn't have reservations but they were still able to seat us. Our waiter made some great suggestions since it was my first time. Literally, everything I had was good. There is nothing I can say negative about my experience. Everything is nicely priced in my opinion. The inside has the perfect noise level to have a conversation with your guest.  I will definitely be back and highly recommend.",5
"One of the best burgers I have ever had.Founding Farmers is a great restaurant. We liked it so much that we ate here twice on our trip to DC.I took my kids to DC for my first vacation in more than four years. I had read great things but had so many other places on our list. But one night we were at the hotel and worn out. When I checked, this location was only two blocks away. Two very cold (below 20 degrees) blocks but close enough to walk.Make a reservation on open table or prepare to wait. It is that popular. On the first visit, we got the spinach dip and I got the cheeseburger. Damn, son. This burger is awesome. So awesome that my mouth is watering as I think about it. So awesome that I am considering abandoning my flight and going get another one. But seriously, get the burger. The fries that accompany it are equally great. My one complaint is that they only bring one ramekin of ketchup. I used like five. I love me some ketchup.The second night we got the crab and artichoke dip. Holy hell man. This is awesome too. I decided to skip the burger and get steak and frites with macaroni and cheese. This was also great!We also tried apple pie, chocolate cake, and death by chocolate sundae. All were as good as the appetizers and main courses.The food here is wonderful. If you are a DC local, you are lucky. If you are a visitor, get yourself here ASAP.",5
"The reviews speak for themselves, but I will throw in my opinion. It was great! I came for breakfast at opening on a weekday and it did start to fill in a bit, but it wasn't too full or too loud that early.The founding farmers breakfast allows you to customize your meal to your liking. The scrambled eggs were to die for, they must put a good amount of milk or cream in there to fluff them up. The chicken apple sausage is an uncommon restaurant item but was delicious and superior to pork sausage (yeah I said it.) The apple walnut bread was also special, not too sweet, but a great alternative to plain toast.They also have pancakes, waffles, and French toast with great toppings. The French toast isn't a big portion, but the presentation of stacking bread like Jenga pieces was really cute.The plats have the old time vintage but still DC vibe, the second floor gives a little view, and the bathrooms were nice with those full doors and a sink basin (it's the little things I like). Overall, since I didn't have to wait, totally loved the experience, the service, the ambiance, and the food. No wonder this place is so popular.",5
"Very cool place to come and eat as a group, chill with a date, or just enjoy by yourself. We decided to join our family friends for dinner here after moving our Howard University students back into their places. We were a party of 8 and the place was very accommodating and nice to dine in.There is a front host/hostess station for checking in. The decor and farmer design element is very cool. There is also merchandise for sale up front. We were seated, and we were immediately contacted by our server for drink orders. He was very customer service oriented. he came back and we gave him appetizer orders for the table to share. The appetizers came out within about 15 minutes and they were all good.We had eight entrées come out and everything was very tasty. Our party enjoyed the whole meal and vibe of the place. Parking can be challenging, as with everything in DC, but there are ParkMobile app spaces all around this area.We will surely visit again and this is one of our DC places to dine.",5
"Founding Farmers is solid! Great fresh made to order food in a comfy environment with staff that pay attention to details. Upon entry the host was super cordial and friendly. I didn't have reservations but that didn't matter. Although the location was busy I only had a short five minute wait. The atmosphere is upscale cozy and the wait staff not only were friendly but also super attentive. The crab cake benny's were really good! Flavorful. Eggs poached perfectly. English muffin toasted just right. Is $25 a little steep of a price, sure, but it was definitely worth it.",5
"I came here for my birthday today, and the entire experience was amazing. Our waiter Victor is literally the best waiter in DC. He was so accommodating for our special needs daughter and he answered so many questions. All of the recommendations he made were amazing choices. Food was so good. You have to come here!!!",5
"Happy Birthday, Stephanie! We're thrilled to hear that you had an amazing experience celebrating with us. Victor truly is a gem, and we're so glad he could accommodate your special needs. Thank you for your kind words about the food and service. We look forward to welcoming you back soon! -Tiffany",5

We went to the one on Pennsylvania Avenue.",5
"Lucked out with a brunch reservation after the cancer walk. Food was good. There was some issues with my coffee and the manager straightened it out. Beautiful patio.We all had a great time.Reservations are highly recommended, long wait otherwise. It's a crowded ppopular place. So we really enjoyed sitting outside.",5
"I went with a large group as a walk in on New Years Eve and we were lucky enough to be able to get a table. The service is excellent, from start to finish; Edgar was a great server, attentive, and knowledgeable. Everything was good except one person ordered the dry aged ny strip medium rare and it came out super super dry and cooked; they replaced it with Shrimp risotto which was very salty. The bacon wrapped dates were delicious, the cornbread amazing, the spinach dip perfect. I had the seven cheese mac n cheese with chicken tenders, they were the best tenders I've had yet. Everyone else was super happy with their food which included the chicken pot pie, milanesa, tomato soup. The desserts are great as well. The chocolate strawberry had great flavor, the bread pudding was to die for, and the warm cookies were the best. Thank you Edgar!",5
I really love Founding Farmers. I see why it's a staple in the DC metro area. I have been here a few times for a casual breakfast and then also for dinner. My food hit 8 times out of 10 (it missed for dinner for ME but I definitely prefer them for breakfast.) The quick breakfast hit the spot as always and out server stayed a moment to chat with us about his baby when he saw my baby in the carrier. Not to mention the host helping with finding a spot for the stroller and then retrieving it when it was time to leave. Always a nice visit to FF.,5
"I ordered fried chicken & waffle. $24.99 came with 1 thigh 1 breast southern style, green beans w/ white gravy & Mac & cheese. Also ordered rosella margarita $14 extremely good. It was packed inside we had to 20min to get seated. I'd recommend. 10 out of 10!",5
"Such a yummy experience! This was my first time dining here and I was not disappointed. The service was fast, the food was good, and there was something for everyone. Their coffee was also very yummy! I'm looking forward to coming back here again soon.",5
"What a wonderful time! I think the reputation speaks for itself, but I'll just add my two cents as well. The servers here were great and attentive, and food was out so quick. The place is lively, but I didn't feel like I was forgotten. I ate here alone and managed to put away the brie farm bread and the goat cheese burger with roasted vegetables on the side. The farm bread was delicious, and probably got me halfway full. It was the perfect combination of sweet and crisp and subtle Brie. Delicious! The goat cheese burger was also a delight; I always think the combination of goat cheese and balsamic is untouchable. The roasted vegetables were very good, though a touch sweeter than they needed to be, in my opinion. Overall, a wonderful meal. I was tempted to come back for all my dinners in DC, but alas, there is so much to try. I hope to be back one day!",5
"I arrived at this charming establishment with my colleagues, eager to indulge in some culinary delights. I chose the mussels paired with spicy sausages, alongside a sumptuous shrimp linguine that promised to tantalize my taste buds.
The mussels, nestled in their shells, exuded a fragrance that was both inviting and invigorating. The spicy sausages added a delightful kick, creating a symphony of flavors that danced on my palate. As I savored each tender morsel, I couldn't help but let my creativity flow; once finished, I transformed the remnants of my dish into an art piece--a whimsical arrangement of empty shells that told the story of a truly enjoyable meal.
The shrimp linguine was a masterpiece in its own right, with perfectly cooked pasta enveloped in a luscious sauce that complemented the succulent shrimp beautifully. Together, these dishes created an unforgettable dining experience, filled with laughter and camaraderie, and a touch of artistic flair. Dining here is not just a meal; it's an experience to be savored and remembered.",5
"I came here without a reservation on a weekday. I was seated within 10 minutes. I had a trip to the passport agency and wanted to use the remaining time on my parking voucher. Breakfast it was!
Ambiance is nice and trendy. Bathrooms are unisex and one person only. They are pretty large for one person and each has a changing station. I love that because not only women go out to eat with their children. Definitely more modern. Parking isn't great because it's DC. Either street parking, lot parking, or garage parking. I did notice all nearby. Isn't cheap though, roughly $20-$30 dollars during the day and events can be more. Plan ahead.
I had a standard be chicken and waffles that was delicious. The eggs tasted like real eggs, not egg substitute and with no additives. It tasted like the ones you'd make at home. The chicken was deboned (already a fave), juicy, and flavorful. It was crispy and good. The waffles were light and airy and not as dense as I'm used to. A good staple. I had fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. I think I'm going to try this at home. Surprisingly enjoyable, just enough sweetness and tartness.
Service was prompt and friendly. A good experience and I'll definitely return.",5
"Great place with fast service!!
We had the deviled eggs; I would normally reccomend but it was kinda plain tasting for the price; and the presentation was really not it.
Next we had the ravioli with goat cheese; VERY strong cheesey taste if you're okay with that then this is for you. But it was a bit strong for me and I LOVE cheese:
Pot Roast was good and worth the price. Place was real nice and everyone was very sweet.
I got Beignets as a dessert but devoured it so quick I couldnt get a picture! SOFT And delicious.",5
"This food was amazing. The service as well. The playlists were great and everything was great!
We went at 11am on a Sunday so it was packed. I couldn't get any pics because of it.
Only negative was when we were left was that the lights in the bathroom went out when we were gonna use the bathroom but other that everything was great. Will definitely come back to this location.",5
I met a large group here after work and since I showed up first I grabbed a drink at the bar. The bartender was pleasant and quick. I ordered a rum punch and it was ok. Around $20 including the tip. At the table I ordered a sugar free citrus & mint seltzer. Divine! I ate the New Brunswick stew and it was good. I think it was about $50 including the tip. The waitress was impressive. She knew the entire menu and took care of our large group so efficiently.,5
"Victor was fabulous in his service and recommendations in food and wine suggestions.
Really love dinning here. Will definitely be back",5
"Really enjoyed our meal at founding farmers! We came for lunch here and the food did not disappoint. I ordered the pastrami melt and it was delicious. The shaved pastrami was so soft and tender, the Cole slaw mix in the salad was the perfect balance inside the sandwich. I liked that it also came with fries.
Our waitress was so nice and even gave us some great recommendations. The ambiance and decor is really nice. It's very spacious restaurant with 2 floor and I love the round tables they offer upstairs.",5
Amazing service from Jorge! 10/10 recommend eating here and having him as your server,5
"I get why Founding Farmers is such a popular spot. This place is huge, with tons of seating on the lower level and upper level. I love how they have their own chocolates and coffee for sale too. We didn't have a reservation but were able to snag a table for two. I had a Nitro Cold Brew and Coconut Chia Bowl. Great cold brew and fantastic chai bowl. The bowl was so good, I gotta figure out how to make it at home!
Street parking is manageable on the weeks, but almost impossible during the week. Better to walk if you can.",5
"These Founding Farmers cooked up some truly revolutionary food! This place has a lively, energetic vibe that draws you in, making it feel like the spot to be at in DC. We started off in a cramped circular booth upstairs right by the stairs, but were lucky enough to switch to a much nicer seat downstairs. The Good All Green salad was surprisingly tasty--the photo doesn't do it justice. Chips and salsa were alright, but the mains were the star of the show. Prices are on the higher side, but justified enough for the great atmosphere and quality food!",5
