Disappointing Food, But Great ServiceWe recently dined at The Founding Fathers, and while we were impressed with the service, the food left much to be desired. The staff was attentive, friendly, and accommodating, which we truly appreciated. However, our meal didn't meet expectations.We ordered steak, which turned out to be tough and not enjoyable. For a restaurant of this caliber, we expected much better quality. Unfortunately, the food was a significant disappointment and overshadowed the otherwise excellent service.It's unfortunate that our dining experience fell short because the team's effort and hospitality were fantastic. We hope the kitchen can address these issues to match the high standard set by the front-of-house staff.

We had a reservation on a Sunday afternoon and it was PACKED! Even with the reservation it took 20+ mins to be seated, so definitely recommend a reservation. With how busy it was, service was still pretty good. The ambiance is cozy and there's plenty of upstairs seating. The food however was extremely lack luster. The beignets were actually pretty tasty, but the spinach dip wasn't very good and the blueberry compote waffles were just sad. I don't really understand the hype around this place. I definitely wouldn't come back!

I'm still trying to process the disappointing dinner experience at Founding Farmers - Washington. The service was painfully slow, and the staff seemed overwhelmed.To make matters worse, we were seated at our table only to have a large family seated right next to us shortly after. You'd think they'd prioritize the guests who arrived first, but nope! The family received their food and drinks before us, despite arriving after us.The food itself was a letdown. Overpriced and underseasoned, the fried chicken dish was a disappointment. The green beans, ironically, had more flavor than the main event. The drinks, however, were the redeeming quality of our meal.Overall, I'd say Founding Farmers - Washington needs to revisit their service strategy and rework their menu pricing. Until then, I'd recommend exploring other options in the area.

We were seated quickly, despite not having a reservation, which was a pleasant surprise. The service was generally good. When we tried to adjust our order, requesting a large mac and cheese for the kids instead of two small portions, we learned that the orders go straight to the kitchen as soon as they're entered, which made any changes impossible.The first two kids' meals arrived surprisingly fast. We also ordered about four appetizers, which were all delicious--fried green tomatoes, blue cheese bacon dates, deviled eggs, and ahi tuna bites. For the main course, we ordered two farmhouse platters, while I opted for the herbed-crusted prime rib with mashed potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts.One of the farmhouse platters arrived first, and most of the group was served while the second platter and my prime rib were still MIA. By the time the last two plates finally showed up, five out of our seven guests had already finished their meals. That's when things started to go downhill.This is where it gets bizarre borderline diabolical. The prime rib was a huge disappointment. It was thin--about ¾ of an inch--and appeared to have been forgotten on the heated shelf for too long. What made it even worse was that someone had the strange idea to sear it. I can't even begin to understand why. The result was a tough, chewy prime rib that barely scored a 3/10. The Brussels sprouts were underwhelming, lacking the roasted flavor I had hoped for.The meal had been going well up until the long delays and the prime rib fiasco. And to top it off, the Au Jus was a coagulated mess.

Thank you for sharing your experience, Eduardo. We are glad to hear the appetizers and initial service were enjoyable. We apologize for the delays and the issues with your prime rib and Brussels sprouts. This is not the experience we aim to provide, and we appreciate your feedback as we work to improve. We hope you'll give us another chance to deliver a better meal next time. -Kiara

Review 12:
I was hoping the food at this location was better than the Georgetown location. Unfortunately, it's the same. The food isn't terrible, it's just ok. The worst part is the food isn't hot. I don't understand why they can't serve hot food. The au ju for the sandwich was room temp as indicated by the texture, it was gelatinous which is a good sign since you know it's not made from powder. The highlight was the service. Our server was really nice and attentive. Extra star was the service

Review 14:
Founding Farmers seems to be known for being overpriced and pretty mid (and full of tourists) and unfortunately my visit last week confirmed that. They used to be known as a restaurant with a large menu that could accommodate almost any tastes, but that's sadly not the case anymore--when I first went six years ago there were many clearly labeled options on the menu for different diets, but this last time, ordering plant-based was a real struggle. No dish on the menu is plant-based as-is. Apparently even none of their breads are vegan, which struck me as really weird. I was the only vegan diner in my group but no one else was too impressed with their dishes either. Hope they reconsider their menu. The extra star here is for the staff, who seemed quite busy but tried to be accommodating and helpful despite the menu!

Had just arrived in DC and was hungry so I went with some of my colleagues.  It was a great night in DC so we out outside but the service  and food were lacking.  WE ordered the ahi tuna bites, crab cakes and cracker crusted shrimp and had to sent the fries back because they were cold.  Not worthy of a return visit.

Overrated ::clap, clap, clap, clap, clap:: I've been here probably a dozen of times over the years, but this is the first time I've come back in the last year and I regret it. Prices are sky high for food that's best described as "meh," passable, or mediocre.  Example: Dry cheeseburger where the beef wasn't seasoned and the edges of the bacon weren't cooked. Another example: spinach dip that was separated, wet, and looked like a baby's spit up.  I could go on, but I won't.  Goodbye FF, I wish you well and hope you return to the quality you had years ago.

Food: green tomatoes didn't come hot. They were a little difficult to cut and chew. Pot pie and pot roast were okay. Menu has a lot of variety. Service: Our waitress had an attitude. My husband is hard of hearing and when she had to repeat herself, she gave him a nasty look. Kind of ruined the experience. Ambiance: very busy and a little noisy. Bathrooms are clean and nice. Floors can be slippery so watch what shoes you wear. Interior is nice.

Review 22:
Tried this place for quick eats near our hotel. I got the scallops and risotto and the risotto was more like yellow rice mushy and overcooked- did not love. Everything didn't have much taste. Friend got the Steak Frites- the fries and bearnaise were good. Steak was tough. Overall was underwhelmed. The key lime pie was great tho

Interesting menu, but the food was somewhat dull. Service was great to start, but got worse and surprisingly they rushed us out without offering dessert (at 9pm when they closed at 11pm)

==================================================

Review 26:
First time to this restaurant.
Ordered one of our favor dish traditional eggs Benedict. Just ok. Nothing special. The bread/biscuit is soft and flavorless.
Ordered a side of cheesy grits. Not cheesy at all. I tried to doctor the flavor. Not working! Grapefruit juice good.
Ordered a side of garlic spinach, delicious. Only thing I enjoyed.
The restaurant is very nice . Seating inside and outside. Our waitress was pleasant, professional

Review 27:
So, as a previous vegetarian, I was obsessed with this place. However, as a vegan, my honest assessment is 1-2 stars for the food. I've come 2 more times as a vegan before adding this review, and the food has been horrible each time. How does this restaurant not know how to cook vegetables? Please don't ask what cook I want on my cauliflower steak.... Just cook it. A raw cauliflower steak is not ok, and when I'm saying "make sure it's cooked.... Whatever that requires, medium well? Well?" And you still bring it to me hard, then you're not even cooking to your "temperatures." My entire meal came out cold, and likewise, my green beans were nearly raw. I couldn't eat them, I left the entire portion on my plate. The only good thing about my meals on these two times was the spaghetti squash and marinara, which did come out warm and had a good flavor. I appreciate you having this option.
However, on our last time in, our server, Kate, is responsible for me adding this star, and she deserves 10 stars. Best server I've ever had actually, and she came to my table having already checked every single item and confirming it was vegan (aka, bringing the dessert menu and saying "well I checked, but I'm sorry, none of our desserts are vegan." Not surprised by this fact, but was highly impressed she even checked before I had to ask!). Overall, if eating the standard america diet or even vegetarian, this place is for you... and only you, which is so terribly disappointing.

==================================================

Review 28:
I used to love this place but its service has been worsened so much after pandemic. I'm local and regular. This is not the first or second, but third time in a row that experienced such bad service. This time I decide to write a review because it was just the worst.
I came here with my tourist friends who are non-native speakers. I could tell our server didn't check on us as frequently as other tables nearby and sometimes ignored us. He just asked "everything good?" then quickly moved to other tables. We ordered a soup and shrimp and grits which is like a soupy one. We didn't get spoons and the server never came back checking on us. I ended up going to a station and grab some spoons myself. When we asked for a check, he didn't even asked we want boxes.
Again, this is the third time in a row that I'm so disappointed by its service. I will probably never go back. And I will never recommend this place to tourists from other countries.

==================================================

Review 29:
Was nearby GWU and looking for some place to eat dinner without a wait. Was able to make an Open Table reservation for 15 minutes in the future. When I got there, there were people waiting outside for what looked like longer than 15 mins so they must not know how to use the internet. The host and waitress both seemed very friendly. I got the prime rib and it was very mediocre. The salt shakers did not work. Our server kind do forgot about us once we ordered. The wings were mediocre, tasted more like teriyaki wings than black garlic pepper. Took forever to get our bill and a box for the leftover wings. Very mediocre meal and slow service after the initial friendliness. Prices weren't cheap, especially considering the mediocre quality and taste.

==================================================

Review 30:
They were able to accommodate our request for outdoor seating in early November, which was nice. Service was pretty prompt despite being outside. They provided heaters to keep us warm.
The reason for my 2-star review is primarily my order of the prime rib dip. I will admit I ordered it without the sauce or the onions because I am a picky eater, but I was very unimpressed with the end result. The meat itself was very thin and dry, and there was very little cheese. However, my worst problem was the "dip" -- I don't know what was wrong with it but it was like a clear greasy animal fat jelly. It put me off my meal. My husband's burger was also quite underdone when he ordered it medium well.
The rest of our party enjoyed their meals and the fries are really good.

==================================================

Review 31:
So so so disappointing! I'm surprised that this restaurant continues to be popular despite the rip off in quality of food.
I'd been to Founding Farmers a few years back and didn't recall it being an extremely bad experience. I decided to try it again but unfortunately as vegetarians we were left disappointed.
They do have a whole meatless section and side dishes, but wow, the taste was barely anything and just cooked with no seasoning. We got the sides of French-Cut Green Beans (neither any flavor nor interesting texture whatsoever and a little undercooked). The Zucchini & Peas was the bare minimum in taste value.
For the veggie main options, quite a few could only be made using egg (e.g. the bread of the sandwich and bun of burger are made with egg). They couldn't even replace them with regular store quality bread or buns, which I would think is not too much to ask for. We ended up having a Salad, Cauliflower Steak, Veggie Cheeseburger, and Veggie Loaf. Funnily enough, after figuring out what we could have for a long time, the salad came with a bread on top. We easily removed it, but still that was funny.
I had the Cauliflower Steak. I'm not one to choose that dish often, but I thought they might give an interesting spin on it. I was so wrong. It came with the same tasteless green beans, tasteless mushroom risotto (I don't even remember really tasting mushroom) and really not memorable cauliflower. Everyone else didn't really thoroughly enjoy their dishes. Probably the Veggie Loaf was the most doable, but still the least that can be expected from this caliber of a restaurant.
For dessert, I got one of the few eggless options, which was the Chocolate Strawberries. I got the 5 for $10.99 option. The presentation was so bad lol, they were just placed on a plate, no effort, like if one were to haphazardly place them at home after they're just made. They were alright in taste, but for the price and reputation of the restaurant, extremely disappointing.
Given the long wait time, steep prices and the additional service charge for the sub-par quality in food, I would not recommend coming here, especially as vegetarians.
I increased the stars to two stars from one because my mom had left her phone in the restaurant and they put it in their safe, so we were able to pick it up the next day. Thank you!

Review 32:
This is the epitome of "could have been better".
My niece raved about this place, so when we came into town to celebrate her graduating from law school, she picked this place. Said she loved the food, and she took care of reservations for seven.
Now, it's graduation season, and we know the place is going to be busy, but damn.
We got in and told one front desk person that we were all here. That person neglected to put into the system that we were all there, and thusly could be seated, so we stood around waiting for 10-15 until an employee asked if we had been helped. "Oh! So sorry!"
We sit, put our orders in. My nephew gets a chicken salad, and asks for no avocado, no honey mustard, and ranch. My niece, the honoree, gets a stead, medium-well. I get the shrimp and crab risotto.
My nephew gets a chicken salad with avocado, a ton of honey mustard, and no ranch.
My niece gets steak frites, with medium rare steak.
I get clumps of moist rice with shrimp and crab meat in it.
Now, my nephew notes the error and gets the right salad. The waitress is very apologetic.
What happens over the next hour and change is a comedy of errors. My niece sends the steak back to get it to cook some more...and it never comes back. She asks about it, and it comes back at the right temperature, but now her fries are cold as hell. So they take the whole plate and come back with everything right. Meanwhile, everyone else is eating and she is..unhappy.
Like I said, comedy of errors. I have no doubt this place could be good. Their menu had some magical-sounding things. The management was polite and apologetic, the waitstaff very nice. But good lord was this a horrendous experience, and while she may be back, we as a family will not.

Review 33:
The best french toast I've ever had! Two stars because the floor at the exit was slippery and I fell on my knees but no one came to check or anything. Disappointed at the service.

==================================================

Review 34:
The food is mediocre. My daughter's salad was missing two of the listed ingredients. Very busy and the waitstaff is friendly.

==================================================

Review 35:
Crazy crowded and loud. Decided it was too much and I would not enjoy it.
I decided to go to Tatte cafe. Had a great bowl of roasted eggplant, onion, tomatoes, spinach with a poached egg on top.

Review 36:
After a wonderful first experience at the DC location, I returned with my family, only this time to the Foggy Bottom site. I was terribly disappointed. The service was slow and we felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff and food runners.
Starting with the drinks, my wife's Aperol Spritz was flat, requiring a remake. That's normally not a problem, except that it wasn't remade until 1/2 through dinner...it was ordered when we were seated.
The food tasted great, however when it was brought out, they left my burger sitting on the expo line. By the time I finally got my food, the rare burger had been cooked medium well, the bun was dry and the fry's were not eatable. Moreover, we never had a two bite food quality check. That would have pointed out that the food drop was incomplete. Finally, the food runners actually ran away. I tried to ask for an extra plate for my 4 year old daughter, but was left feeling silly for speaking to myself.
The vibe in the restaurant was nice. It wasn't too busy, there were completely empty tables around us. That's what makes this experience disappointing. The food saved lunch, but the service was terrible. They never even cleared our table. We had a stack of dirty plates as we ate and we needed extra napkins, but we could never ask for them.
The service was not what I expected, we all felt as if we were an inconvenience. I'm disappointed. I gave 2 starts because my drink was nice and everyone else was content with the food...we hoped for thrilled, not content.

Review 37:
I hate writing bad reviews and usually will not do it at all unless I feel that strongly about an institution.
Was visiting the DC area and wanted a good breakfast. Ordered the founding farmers breakfast with eggs, steak & hash browns. Eggs were great. Hash browns were alright. But the steak....oh my gosh.
I ordered my steak medium. Came out closer to medium rare; super bloody & I could barely cut through the piece of meat. Ended up telling the server, she said the kitchen would fire up another one. Got ANOTHER steak...same issue. And it was unreal. I understand maybe just messing up once. But...twice? The seasoning/marinade smelled and tasted AMAZING, all I wanted was to enjoy the steak.
The manager or whoever was in charge stopped by to see how everything was & asked if they could do anything. At that point, after 2 undercooked steaks..I just wanted to pay and leave. For an establishment that's reviewed well SO highly, I had much much MUCH higher expectations.
My friend and I also got the beignets & the inside was SPONGY. She was in NOLA and had real beignets, and I doubt that spongy is the texture anyone is going for. Also ordered French toast & those were underwhelming too.
I had high hopes for this spot because of raving reviews but I was beyond disappointed. I definitely don't recommend this spot for breakfast.

==================================================

Review 38:
I hate to write this as I have previously had a positive experience at the Pennsylvania Ave NW location but when i revisted on 3/8/24 I had friends in town and our reservation, meal, & my follow up message to mgmt have all been handled so poorly. We were very late being seated for our 7P reservation, it even looked as if others arriving after us were seated before us. Perhaps they were more persistent, but we had a reservation, we shouldn't have to be aggressive about being seated.
It took a while for our food to arrive & based on the temp, it had likely been sitting in the window. My fried platter of fries, shrimp, crabcake & fish was room temperature at best. I reported these things through their company website. It's been weeks without a response from mgmt. It's not cheap to dine out and we were a party of 5. The ball was dropped several times. We did not get what we paid for.

==================================================

Review 39:
I was excited to try this place out, since we had already tried to get in before and it was too busy. But honestly I was very disappointed. The service was slow, the prices were high, and the food was bland.
I got the Seven Cheese Macaroni (plus the chicken tenders on top, which was an extra $6 for only 3 medium strips of chicken) and my wife got the Straw and Hay Bucatini. Neither of us really liked our meals. The macaroni and cheese was completely tasteless and bland, and my wife had the same complaint about her bucatini.
Not to mention, there is a 5% "Restaurant Recovery Charge" that is automatically added to every ticket. Their reasoning for this is "to cover pandemic-related losses and debts". I understand it was hard to survive as a restaurant during Covid, but that was 3 years ago, there is absolutely no reason to continue to charge more. If you can't survive as a business without this recovery charge, then add it to your overall food prices instead of hiding it as an additional charge (their prices are already extravagant, $6 for 3 pieces of chicken added on top of a bland $19 Mac and Cheese? Really?). For me, this reason alone was enough to justify never coming back.
There was one positive, however, the bathrooms were extremely clean.

==================================================

Review 40:
No a DC local, but was recommended this place by a friend. Unfortunately, it does not live up the it's rating on Yelp.
Food:
The chicken pot pie was decent. The biscuit on top was flaky and paired well with the cream pie filling. However, the filling was a bit sweet for my liking.
The chicken fried steak was a huge mis-steak. Usually fried steak is dry, but this was a whole drought. On top of that the batter around the steak was not adhesive and fell off with the slightest touch. Worst of all, the steak was not seasoned at all, while the batter that fell off was overly salty.
The side of fries were inconsistent, some fries were perfectly golden brown, while others were soggy. This most likely means the fries were sitting under a heat lamp for some time.
Drink:
We got a pint of Victory Golden Monkey. The flavors were great, but it came in a very sad plastic kids cup like the ones you found in 1980's pizza joint.
Service:
The service was one of the redeeming factors. Our service was very gracious and checked up on our table often to refill our waters.
