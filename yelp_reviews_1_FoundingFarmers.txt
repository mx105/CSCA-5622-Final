I am so shocked that I have to write this, but it's based on THIS location and not the other location I I went to. We order doordash (pretty simple, right) 2 fried chicken meals (one with white meat mash potatoes/green beans) and the other a spicy fried chicken meal (Dark meat, Mac and cheese with collard greens). Nothing crazy or complicated.When it arrived, it was cold, with overcooked chicken that was not even correct. My meal didn't even have collard greens, and the mac/cheese was pathetic. Our chicken was atrocious, and we couldn't even east it. Doordarshan gave us credit, and this meal was not cheap either (nearly 90 bucks)I will not be going to this location. Don't let that 4 star rating fool you.

DO NOT BE MISLED BY THEIR REVIEW RATING--CONSIDER THIS A WARNING.As someone that's enjoyed the experiences at the Tysons location, the service we experienced today at this DC location was well below acceptable standards. For a restaurant with such strong reviews, the level of service was shockingly poor. The food was mediocre at its best, delayed significantly. We had to ask for our appetizer, which came without utensils or napkins--another 10 minutes until we had to request them from another staff.  A noticeable lack of attentiveness from the server, who didn't check on us or refill our water, despite our glasses being empty for some time. No syrup with pancakes until we had to wait for the server to walk by and stop the server to remind him. Two tables behind and front of us that were seated after us were served well before us. The overall experience was far from what I've come to expect. While the place was busy, that doesn't excuse the poor service. The entire experience left such a bad taste, particularly given the circumstances of hosting a farewell. This was a disappointing visit and not reflective of the standard one should expect from a restaurant with such reviews.

Abusive pricing system, overworked and not enough staff, tables stacked up against each other, screaming babies, bad food. The great: the wait is long, the place was packed, the farm to table sales pitch was top notch. People want to be here. The good: nice bathrooms, good candy packages to go. Good water bottle so you can refill your own glass. The cornbread is very corny, obviously homemade and good. I recommend it. The average: the beer list was underwhelming and the beers on tap are rated very low on untapped.The poor: the wait staff is so overwhelmed and overworked they can't ask you how your food or drink is. If you have a problem good luck. I had to waive down a waiter when the family next to me broke a glass on the table. The tables are jammed so close together the staff has to be fairly acrobatic to get around and too few of them. The restaurant doesn't care cause $$$The terrible. Where to begin. You should not leave a place hungry but here we are. Food was nuclear  (spicy), could not touch it, left food uneaten, pushed my salad around a bit. My old fashioned bourbon drink was a sugary mess couldn't go further than a sip. It should have some taste other than sugar.  Maybe there should be a general warning to northern yankees?   I didn't complain about food or drink, so that's on me, but honestly staff has no time and didn't ask why my dinner and drink were full.  They don't even ask "how did you like it" but again they are carrying massive loads all the time. We gave a bit more than 20% tip. Poor guy earned it. The "cover your eyes": the pricing. A 5% surtax for workers mental health, a 12% sales tax, those two combined are nearly 20% of the bill. Then a 20% tip on the food and on those 2 items. Let's distribute the nearly 40% on the prices. Small Glass of wine $24 (how much was the larger glass version) cornbread $16, the 4 very small shrimp added to salad $13.  Can they just list the actual price and be done with the +5%+12%+20% formula, shouldn't be a math class.

Review 10:
One of the most overrated (if not the most overrated) restaurants in Washington, D.C., and has been for years. I have been here a few times over the years and the food has not been top-notch since at least 2011. I recently went with some colleagues for a weekday lunch and was once again disappointed. We had an 11:30 reservation, intentionally scheduled before the lunch rush. While our party was immediately seated and we were able to quickly order drinks, our server did not return to our table for over 15 minutes, even though the restaurant was half empty. After we finally flagged our server and put in our orders, the food took over 15 minutes to come. Once we got the food, it was extremely mediocre. I started with a cup of coffee, which was weak and rather tasteless-it was only a step or two up from airplane coffee. I drink my coffee black and I expect that a restaurant of this caliber could make a cup of coffee that does not need cream and sugar to taste good; needless to say they did not.I got the fried chicken and waffles for my main dish and it left much to be desired. The only good part of the dish was the breast meat, which was juicy. Otherwise, the gravy was tasteless and added nothing, the syrup tasted artificial, the waffle was something that I would get at a budget hotel breakfast, and the butter was slathered over the waffle, rather than in a carafe where I could spread it myself. For dessert, our group shared some chocolate cake, which was dry and flavorless other than the icing. It did not even taste store-bought; store-bought is better.If you are going to try one of the restaurants in this group, I recommend Farmers and Distillers. If you want to have lunch in Foggy Bottom, go to one of the casual places at 20th St and I St NW.

This review is for food only as I ordered takeout. I was so excited because the menu looks terrific. I had the fried chicken which had absolutely zero flavor. Zero taste. It was cooked just fine but with no seasoning or flavor. The macaroni and cheese was lacking flavor as well and the mashed potatoes were OK at best but was missing gravy.                   The fried okra would've been good. It was cooked well but again no seasoning at all. The chef needs to use some seasoned salt or garlic salt or something anything. The peanut butter pie was a joke. I expected a peanut butter mousse made with, sweetened condensed milk, whipped cream, etc. with peanut butter but instead it was only peanut butter itself. It was awful to say the least. Got to say thumbs down. Terrific menu, awful execution.

Review 14:
By far one of the most traumatic eating experiences. Everything was fine untill I started eating my meal and I realized the texture of the chicken was off. I had asked myself, is this cooked? Unfortunately  to my surprise it was not, the chicken was pink. I called my waiter over and asked for it to be sent back. Lo and behold the second meal that came back was still not fully cocked. Completely ruined my night. I don't know if it was because it was close to closing and the kitchen was over it but it sure seemed like it. I spoke to the manager and she acknowledged that the chicken was not cooked and comped the bill. I didn't feel  think they took it very seriously considering you know salmonella and all... This use to be one of my favorite food chain but since this happened I haven't been able to go back. My friend order pasta and I guess it was slightly underdone so she got fried rice instead which I had a taste of and it was pretty good.

Review 16:
One of the worst lunches we had during this vacation, if not the worst. It started off well, the hostess greeted us kindly and we were sat quickly. However, our server that came (didn't introduce herself so not sure what her name is) came with dirty water cups. We couldn't get clean cups until we were half way through our entrees because our server never came to check on us. When we got too thirsty, we asked the hostess, who said she couldn't leave the host stand and told us to wait for our server or another staff.The food was also terribly mediocre. I ordered the fried chicken with waffles and my sister ordered an avocado toast. The chicken was too salty, the green beans were tasteless/no seasoning, and the avocado toast was also too salty. We had chips and dips as appetizer which was the best dish out of the three. The only downside was the extra salsa came after we finished the chips. The lady manager with glasses was very sweet, though. She only came at the very end when we were leaving but her kind remarks improved the ending of this highly disappointing lunch. Overall, we had high expectations from all the great reviews and the recommendations from the blogs. We left unhappy with our choice and will not be coming back.

Hi Lee. I am sorry to hear about your disappointing experience. While I'm glad the manager made a positive impact at the end, it’s unfortunate that the service and quality of the meal didn’t reflect the high standards you were hoping for. Your feedback is valuable, and I hope the restaurant addresses these issues to ensure future diners have a better experience. This said, please email me at: Hospitality@FRG.Farm with a copy of your review, date dined, and location. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. -Jessica

We planned to have Christmas dinner here.  We booked reservations for 5:15 pm.  Arrived at 4:45 pm and upon our arrival, the line to check in was long.  We check in and were told a 30 min to 1 hour wait from our reservation time, not 4:45 pm.  We were told they overbooked and when you  we went to the Open Table app, they were still taking reservations for 5:30 pm.  We confirmed our reservation via phone (see screenshot of voicemail) and called to confirm. I am not sure who is managing, though I sure overbooking is good to compensate for those who do not show up but this is awful.  Then being charged $20 to hold when booking, well SMDH.  I can say, they made our first Christmas away from home a memorable one.....but we found a restaurant who met...far exceeded our expectations and recommend Toryumon Japanese Restaurant

DO NOT ORDER THEM THROUGH UBER EATS!! I guess they feel, "you'll get what I send you"! I got my fried chicken salad and guess what was in the container...LETTUCE, ONE tomato HALF and chicken! REALLY?! Thank goodness I had salad dressing, onions and everything else that SHOULD HAVE BEEN in the salad! Maybe that was the universe telling me next I have the stuff at home just make it myself?! If they didn't have the ingredients, a call would've been nice and I would have had the opportunity to choose a replacement! Just TERRIBLE!

Thank you for your review, Tahja! I am so happy to read about your dining experience! Please join us when you are craving the southern fried chicken salad and almond chocolate bars again! -Najjah :)

==================================================

Review 22:
The Southern Chicken salad and the fried shrimp are absolutely divine. Their almond chocolate bar is scrumpdillyumptious (if you're lucky to snag one...they sell out FAST)! Shrimp rolls are super yummy too! ONLY ONE thing that I got and didn't care for were the shrimp dumplings! My taste buds just didn't "get it"!Customer service and ambiance are amazing and this is one of my go to spots! I am sure you will enjoy them as much as I do!! Enjoy!

==================================================

Review 23:
Overall a poor dining experience. Started off with the prosciutto farm bread which was decent. I would give it a 5/10 because it was covered with way too much balsamic. The quality of prosciutto was good though. The main issue was the entree. I ordered the sausage and mushroom gnocchi, which was unfortunately a huge let down. The sausage crumbles was burnt to a crisp on one side, and it ruined the flavor of the entire dish. The gnocchi and mushrooms all had an extremely burnt aftertaste. When the waiter asked how the food was, we said one of the dishes had a problem, and he just said "okay" without any further questions or help. Would definitely not come back here ever again.

Hi, Matthew. Thank you for sharing the details of this visit with us. From the start, it seems like we dropped the ball with your starter, and that was only compounded by the issues with your entrée. It is sad to say that we failed at this impression. I would love the chance to turn this around!

Terrible experience having Founding Farmers for dinner.
The service was great, very attentive waiter BUT the food - not so much, poorly flavored prime rib (never getting here again) under cooked sweet potato (Also,since when does a sweet potato only have one side?) and undercooked green beans. I do not recommend this meal - the ambience is lackluster.

Don't get the strawberry and
Cream waffle plate. I poured the syrup on it and completely messed up my food. It was extremely runny and it tasted like it had high fructose corn syrup all in it! No thanks

==================================================

Review 29:
Upon being seated to celebrate an occasion with guests, we heard a thunderous grinding of coffee beans adjacent to our table. We could not hear ourselves think, let alone talk. That's hardly the atmosphere we wanted for a celebration of any type! The machinery should have been placed in the kitchen, away from guests. Moreover, we will not return until Customer 'Care' enters the equation.

==================================================

Review 30:
The bathrooms are unwell kept and look like a gas station. My server was very kind and helpful but the other employees were not as friendly.
A server came in to wait for the restroom and she accidentally turned the lights off but left me in the dark to use the restroom. The restrooms are very dirty, no toilet paper in the rolls, water everywhere all over the floors, toilet paper everywhere on the floor. A restroom says a lot about a restaurant and if it's unkept there for patrons to use, I wonder what their kitchen looks like where nobody can see it.
Disgusting, will not come back.

==================================================

Review 31:
Our server was nice. We were able to secure a reservation 15 minutes before the desired dining time. But the food... the food. Left so much to be desired based on these current Yelp ratings and reviews. I ordered the fried chicken salad with extra dressing and a draft shock top. My mom ordered the cracker crusted shrimp. My dad ordered the farmhouse platter and my son had the baby burgers appetizer (because they don't have a kids menu). My beer was a little warm when it arrived. My salad arrived missing half of the toppings and featuring overcooked/burnt panko-breaded chicken cutlet strips. It looked so unappetizing, so I took the errors in the order as my opportunity to forgo any additional entree at the restaurant. I ended up splitting my mom's shrimp entree because we both weren't too hungry. So regarding the shrimp, it was okay but just not seasoned. It put me in the mind of red lobster as far as the flavor. The cornbread that came with the shrimp appeared to be yellow cake with corn kernels. None at my table were brave enough to actually try it. My toddler son currently prefers a plain hamburger patty so he had no issues. I could tell the fries served with the burgers and shrimp had the potential to be good but they weren't fresh. So the server did replace them and the fresh ones were good with salt and pepper added. My dad's farmhouse platter - in summary, the ribs aren't grilled, the fried chicken was dry, hard, and unseasoned, and again, the burgers were okay.

==================================================

Review 32:
For the money that they are charging the food at the buffet was cold af! Asked my server several times for something never got it. very limited selection ended up going else where to get my money worth. this is a prime example of the food not living up to the name of the establishment shame too because this used to be a nice place

==================================================

Review 33:
Reservation made 6 weeks ago. Arrived 20 minutes early to check in and...
Having a 5 pm reservation and being told you can't seat us "for at least 45 minutes" is VERY unacceptable and unprofessional. Do better!

==================================================

Review 34:
Our server was in training, so we were prepared to be patient. For having a trainee who definitely didn't understand food it was "okay". She didn't seem to know the menu and explained things to us that didn't really make sense. ("Risotto is a rice-like pasta." And "Pinot Grigio is white wine.") However, she was friendly and made a point of sitting down everything.
Our cocktail order took over 30 minutes to arrive. We had half of our appetizers delivered before we saw the drinks. Also our apps arrived in 3 stages with the last round of apps delivered only minutes before our entrees.
I ordered the scallop dish. There was a weird pool of oil on the dish and when I asked the server she looked confused and got a manager. He looked at the pool of oil and said "we melt a little butter on top at the end". I was clearly unhappy with it but he just walked away. Also the risotto was BURIED in parsley. 2 of us ordered risotto dishes and with both the risotto was half undercooked and half mush. One of our party had the gnocchi-- she was sick that night. In general, the service was confused and spotty and the food was mediocre at best. Would definitely not recommend.

==================================================

Review 35:
Great service at the bar but food wasn't what I expected. Grilled Chicken bacon salad water at the bottom of plate bacon was inedible didn't know you can mess up a salad but it's possible Chicken Salad*

==================================================

Review 36:
It was about a month ago when we decided to eat at FF due to its proximity near the Kennedy Center. It may have been an odd night or they had the B team working the kitchen. All of the food was bland and tasteless. It was so weird as I always thought this was a restaurant that prided it self on farm to table food.
Don't let the name Founding Farmers fool you. What they served us, we could have gotten at Applebees.

==================================================

Review 37:
Very disappointed in my experience at this location. I have tried other locations and been very impressed so this experience was a major disappointment.
I ordered on a Sunday night for delivery -- I ordered milk chocolate caramels, sausage mushroom gnocchi, chocolate cake, and a vanilla latte.
First, I was disappointed with my delivery experience. When ordering chocolates, I wouldn't recommend them to be placed on top of the gnocchi because the heat caused the bottom chocolates to melt. Also the delivery charges are interesting... delivery charge of $2.99, a packaging fee of $2.06, and a utensil fee of $0.60.
Concerning the food itself --
The vanilla latte itself was very small, really anytime I order a coffee and the coffee is barely more than half the cup then I am disappointed off the bat, regardless of the taste.
The sausage mushroom gnocchi was extremely salty that it was hard to eat, especially considering that sausage itself is already salty.
The chocolate cake was very one dimensional. When you buy in store it comes with vanilla ice cream but it does not come with vanilla ice cream when you get delivery.

==================================================

Review 38:
We arrived as a walk-in at 9:28am. Hostess told us it would be approx. 35-40min wait time for INDOOR seating so we left our name/number. Granted, it is a Saturday morning and they're busy...we check back after an hour and they told us we were 2nd in line for the next available spot...
25mins later another hostess brought us to outdoor seating (which there was plenty of). We explained to them that we were waiting on INDOOR seating but they said we were backed up and running late on reservations. They even told us they have these heat lamps and assured us everyone will stay warm! It's the middle of November, we were contemplating staying but didn't see a waitress at all close-by. Felt like a huge waste of time especially steering us outside. Definitely not comfortably to eat, would not recommend

==================================================

Review 39:
Don't go to Founding Farmer's if you would like them to accomodate a fish allergy. I went with my wife (who has a fish allergy). She was asking which otems would be safe to eat (a green salad for instance). She was asked if she is OK with cross-contamination????????? What? They said that everything is prepared together and cross-contaminated- their wording. I asked if they could make a fresh salad away from fish and the answer was no- there is fish everywhere.
Very disappointed.

Horrible horrible customer service! Makes me never want to return. My brother was treated with no respect and we were the guests. Just throw the whole restaurant away.
