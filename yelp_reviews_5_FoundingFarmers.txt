AMAZING!! literally everything was a 10/10. We started with the deviled eggs and cocktails, and had the Squash ravioli, veggie loaf, ribeye, and side of the sweet potato and marshmallow fluff for dinner. For dessert, we had the VA peanut butter moose pie.. wow just wow. We also took home the candy bar collection- tastes just like the OG candies, but made with clean ingredients  Our server, Byron, was amazing! He was attentive and kind, and answered all questions! This is the first review I have ever left on yelp.. all to say it is 100% worth it- GO NOW!!!

My friend had been bragging on how good this place was and I finally got to experience it.The staff were amazing. We didn't have reservations but they were still able to seat us. Our waiter made some great suggestions since it was my first time. Literally, everything I had was good. There is nothing I can say negative about my experience. Everything is nicely priced in my opinion. The inside has the perfect noise level to have a conversation with your guest.  I will definitely be back and highly recommend.

One of the best burgers I have ever had.Founding Farmers is a great restaurant. We liked it so much that we ate here twice on our trip to DC.I took my kids to DC for my first vacation in more than four years. I had read great things but had so many other places on our list. But one night we were at the hotel and worn out. When I checked, this location was only two blocks away. Two very cold (below 20 degrees) blocks but close enough to walk.Make a reservation on open table or prepare to wait. It is that popular. On the first visit, we got the spinach dip and I got the cheeseburger. Damn, son. This burger is awesome. So awesome that my mouth is watering as I think about it. So awesome that I am considering abandoning my flight and going get another one. But seriously, get the burger. The fries that accompany it are equally great. My one complaint is that they only bring one ramekin of ketchup. I used like five. I love me some ketchup.The second night we got the crab and artichoke dip. Holy hell man. This is awesome too. I decided to skip the burger and get steak and frites with macaroni and cheese. This was also great!We also tried apple pie, chocolate cake, and death by chocolate sundae. All were as good as the appetizers and main courses.The food here is wonderful. If you are a DC local, you are lucky. If you are a visitor, get yourself here ASAP.

Thank you for the wonderful review, John! We're thrilled you and your kids had such a great time with us during your DC trip. We're glad you loved the cheeseburger and fries! We'll take note of your ketchup request too. :) We can't wait to welcome you back next time you're in the area! -Tiffany

The reviews speak for themselves, but I will throw in my opinion. It was great! I came for breakfast at opening on a weekday and it did start to fill in a bit, but it wasn't too full or too loud that early.The founding farmers breakfast allows you to customize your meal to your liking. The scrambled eggs were to die for, they must put a good amount of milk or cream in there to fluff them up. The chicken apple sausage is an uncommon restaurant item but was delicious and superior to pork sausage (yeah I said it.) The apple walnut bread was also special, not too sweet, but a great alternative to plain toast.They also have pancakes, waffles, and French toast with great toppings. The French toast isn't a big portion, but the presentation of stacking bread like Jenga pieces was really cute.The plats have the old time vintage but still DC vibe, the second floor gives a little view, and the bathrooms were nice with those full doors and a sink basin (it's the little things I like). Overall, since I didn't have to wait, totally loved the experience, the service, the ambiance, and the food. No wonder this place is so popular.

Very cool place to come and eat as a group, chill with a date, or just enjoy by yourself. We decided to join our family friends for dinner here after moving our Howard University students back into their places. We were a party of 8 and the place was very accommodating and nice to dine in.There is a front host/hostess station for checking in. The decor and farmer design element is very cool. There is also merchandise for sale up front. We were seated, and we were immediately contacted by our server for drink orders. He was very customer service oriented. he came back and we gave him appetizer orders for the table to share. The appetizers came out within about 15 minutes and they were all good.We had eight entrées come out and everything was very tasty. Our party enjoyed the whole meal and vibe of the place. Parking can be challenging, as with everything in DC, but there are ParkMobile app spaces all around this area.We will surely visit again and this is one of our DC places to dine.

Founding Farmers is solid! Great fresh made to order food in a comfy environment with staff that pay attention to details. Upon entry the host was super cordial and friendly. I didn't have reservations but that didn't matter. Although the location was busy I only had a short five minute wait. The atmosphere is upscale cozy and the wait staff not only were friendly but also super attentive. The crab cake benny's were really good! Flavorful. Eggs poached perfectly. English muffin toasted just right. Is $25 a little steep of a price, sure, but it was definitely worth it.

Lucked out with a brunch reservation after the cancer walk. Food was good. There was some issues with my coffee and the manager straightened it out. Beautiful patio.We all had a great time.Reservations are highly recommended, long wait otherwise. It's a crowded ppopular place. So we really enjoyed sitting outside.

I went with a large group as a walk in on New Years Eve and we were lucky enough to be able to get a table. The service is excellent, from start to finish; Edgar was a great server, attentive, and knowledgeable. Everything was good except one person ordered the dry aged ny strip medium rare and it came out super super dry and cooked; they replaced it with Shrimp risotto which was very salty. The bacon wrapped dates were delicious, the cornbread amazing, the spinach dip perfect. I had the seven cheese mac n cheese with chicken tenders, they were the best tenders I've had yet. Everyone else was super happy with their food which included the chicken pot pie, milanesa, tomato soup. The desserts are great as well. The chocolate strawberry had great flavor, the bread pudding was to die for, and the warm cookies were the best. Thank you Edgar!

I really love Founding Farmers. I see why it's a staple in the DC metro area. I have been here a few times for a casual breakfast and then also for dinner. My food hit 8 times out of 10 (it missed for dinner for ME but I definitely prefer them for breakfast.) The quick breakfast hit the spot as always and out server stayed a moment to chat with us about his baby when he saw my baby in the carrier. Not to mention the host helping with finding a spot for the stroller and then retrieving it when it was time to leave. Always a nice visit to FF.

I ordered fried chicken & waffle. $24.99 came with 1 thigh 1 breast southern style, green beans w/ white gravy & Mac & cheese. Also ordered rosella margarita $14 extremely good. It was packed inside we had to 20min to get seated. I'd recommend. 10 out of 10!

Such a yummy experience! This was my first time dining here and I was not disappointed. The service was fast, the food was good, and there was something for everyone. Their coffee was also very yummy! I'm looking forward to coming back here again soon.

What a wonderful time! I think the reputation speaks for itself, but I'll just add my two cents as well. The servers here were great and attentive, and food was out so quick. The place is lively, but I didn't feel like I was forgotten. I ate here alone and managed to put away the brie farm bread and the goat cheese burger with roasted vegetables on the side. The farm bread was delicious, and probably got me halfway full. It was the perfect combination of sweet and crisp and subtle Brie. Delicious! The goat cheese burger was also a delight; I always think the combination of goat cheese and balsamic is untouchable. The roasted vegetables were very good, though a touch sweeter than they needed to be, in my opinion. Overall, a wonderful meal. I was tempted to come back for all my dinners in DC, but alas, there is so much to try. I hope to be back one day!

I arrived at this charming establishment with my colleagues, eager to indulge in some culinary delights. I chose the mussels paired with spicy sausages, alongside a sumptuous shrimp linguine that promised to tantalize my taste buds.
The mussels, nestled in their shells, exuded a fragrance that was both inviting and invigorating. The spicy sausages added a delightful kick, creating a symphony of flavors that danced on my palate. As I savored each tender morsel, I couldn't help but let my creativity flow; once finished, I transformed the remnants of my dish into an art piece--a whimsical arrangement of empty shells that told the story of a truly enjoyable meal.
The shrimp linguine was a masterpiece in its own right, with perfectly cooked pasta enveloped in a luscious sauce that complemented the succulent shrimp beautifully. Together, these dishes created an unforgettable dining experience, filled with laughter and camaraderie, and a touch of artistic flair. Dining here is not just a meal; it's an experience to be savored and remembered.

I came here without a reservation on a weekday. I was seated within 10 minutes. I had a trip to the passport agency and wanted to use the remaining time on my parking voucher. Breakfast it was!
Ambiance is nice and trendy. Bathrooms are unisex and one person only. They are pretty large for one person and each has a changing station. I love that because not only women go out to eat with their children. Definitely more modern. Parking isn't great because it's DC. Either street parking, lot parking, or garage parking. I did notice all nearby. Isn't cheap though, roughly $20-$30 dollars during the day and events can be more. Plan ahead.
I had a standard be chicken and waffles that was delicious. The eggs tasted like real eggs, not egg substitute and with no additives. It tasted like the ones you'd make at home. The chicken was deboned (already a fave), juicy, and flavorful. It was crispy and good. The waffles were light and airy and not as dense as I'm used to. A good staple. I had fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. I think I'm going to try this at home. Surprisingly enjoyable, just enough sweetness and tartness.
Service was prompt and friendly. A good experience and I'll definitely return.

Great place with fast service!!
We had the deviled eggs; I would normally reccomend but it was kinda plain tasting for the price; and the presentation was really not it.
Next we had the ravioli with goat cheese; VERY strong cheesey taste if you're okay with that then this is for you. But it was a bit strong for me and I LOVE cheese:
Pot Roast was good and worth the price. Place was real nice and everyone was very sweet.
I got Beignets as a dessert but devoured it so quick I couldnt get a picture! SOFT And delicious.

==================================================

Review 34:
This food was amazing. The service as well. The playlists were great and everything was great!
We went at 11am on a Sunday so it was packed. I couldn't get any pics because of it.
Only negative was when we were left was that the lights in the bathroom went out when we were gonna use the bathroom but other that everything was great. Will definitely come back to this location.

==================================================

Review 35:
I met a large group here after work and since I showed up first I grabbed a drink at the bar. The bartender was pleasant and quick. I ordered a rum punch and it was ok. Around $20 including the tip. At the table I ordered a sugar free citrus & mint seltzer. Divine! I ate the New Brunswick stew and it was good. I think it was about $50 including the tip. The waitress was impressive. She knew the entire menu and took care of our large group so efficiently.

Really enjoyed our meal at founding farmers! We came for lunch here and the food did not disappoint. I ordered the pastrami melt and it was delicious. The shaved pastrami was so soft and tender, the Cole slaw mix in the salad was the perfect balance inside the sandwich. I liked that it also came with fries.
Our waitress was so nice and even gave us some great recommendations. The ambiance and decor is really nice. It's very spacious restaurant with 2 floor and I love the round tables they offer upstairs.

Amazing service from Jorge! 10/10 recommend eating here and having him as your server

I get why Founding Farmers is such a popular spot. This place is huge, with tons of seating on the lower level and upper level. I love how they have their own chocolates and coffee for sale too. We didn't have a reservation but were able to snag a table for two. I had a Nitro Cold Brew and Coconut Chia Bowl. Great cold brew and fantastic chai bowl. The bowl was so good, I gotta figure out how to make it at home!
Street parking is manageable on the weeks, but almost impossible during the week. Better to walk if you can.

==================================================

These Founding Farmers cooked up some truly revolutionary food! This place has a lively, energetic vibe that draws you in, making it feel like the spot to be at in DC. We started off in a cramped circular booth upstairs right by the stairs, but were lucky enough to switch to a much nicer seat downstairs. The Good All Green salad was surprisingly tasty--the photo doesn't do it justice. Chips and salsa were alright, but the mains were the star of the show. Prices are on the higher side, but justified enough for the great atmosphere and quality food!
