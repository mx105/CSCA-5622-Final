Review 7:
Located across from the Western Market that is connected to 2000 Penn where I was working with my business team, my boss chose Founding Farmers because it was convenient and easy walking distance. It just so happened it was also part of a restaurant chain that we had ate the night before at their Georgetown location. Why my boss wanted to eat at their same restaurant two days in a row really is beyond me, but I will say we had the opportunity to enjoy lunch in a different setting, ordering different food. So the experience was different but still consistent.We enjoyed fried green tomatoes and candied bacon sticks for appetizers while I had a fried chicken salad for my main course. Overall, it was solid. It was filling the meal and satisfied without needing to order anything else. The service was on point in an interior that was very city comfort food and bar vibes. Dark gray interiors, warm, dark wood trim, the bar certainly had a happy hour and caters to the nearby business, government, and academic crowd that is dependable.

Thank you for sharing your experience, Jeff! It's great to hear that we delivered consistency across locations, and it sounds like the lunch was both satisfying and enjoyable. We hope you'll visit again for more delightful meals, whether for business or leisure! -Tiffany

I came with a very large group of people on NYE and our server Abby was so on top of it. Despite the big party, everything went really smoothly. Took off a star because I ordered scallops and they were super over cooked. Drinks are ok. Overall, food/drink is solid and good for pleasing a group but nothing to write home about.

==================================================

Thank you for sharing your experience, Jenna! We're thrilled to hear Abby took great care of your large group and that everything ran smoothly. We apologize for the overcooked scallops and appreciate your feedback on the drinks. We're always looking to improve, and we hope to welcome you back soon for a more enjoyable meal! -Jessica

This is a review for brunch here. I came with a large group, and I give mad props to the waitress for handling it so well. In addition, the food here was so good. I ordered the basic breakfast. I'm kind of obsessed with the hashbrowns.  love hashbrowns as it is, and these are particularly flavorful. I'd eat them every morning if I could. This place also takes the refreshing step of seasoning eggs so that they are every bit as good as the more complex things on the plate. I'm not sure what they put on the bread, but I loved it. The only thing I didn't love on the plate was the bacon, which was pretty salty.

==================================================

Review 12:
Stopped by with some friends for their brunch buffet but it's only offered on Sundays I believe. The group I was with raved about this spot so I was excited to try it. The food was okay, I got the burger and onion rings. The burger was just fine, onion rings were honestly not good at all. They accidentally brought me fries with my burger and honestly glad they did because those made up for the onion rings. The wings and biscuits were my absolute favorite part of the meal. If nothing else, you must get the wings as an app! The sodas are made in house which is a cool concept but for the price and no refill I passed on trying them. The service was spotty but overall okay. Will be back to checkout brunch and give them another try.

==================================================

Thank you for stopping by and for giving us your honest feedback, Kriss! We’re glad to hear you enjoyed the wings and biscuits—great choices! Apologies that the burger and onion rings didn’t fully hit the mark. We'll keep working to fine-tune all of our menu items, and we look forward to welcoming you back to try our brunch soon! -Xenia

Review 14:
I'm going to be super honest and say while this place is worth the hype I felt that there were a few details where they fell short of the 5 star experience. Most of the food was next level: The biscuit app and ravioli entree were sooooo good.  I would definitely order those again!n We also  enjoyed  the brie app and while I didn't try the chicken and waffles it looked a really good before my kid inhaled it. Unfortunately the vegetarian loaf (tasteless) and burgers (greasy) were not very good so I suggest skipping those. Our server was really helpful and mostly attentive not sure why we weren't offered dessert, instead our check was dropped and we ended ordering dessert AFTER we paid. Lastly while the restaurant itself is pretty loud our table itself was pretty awful.  We sat right near the drink well and had to listen to all the banging and shaking along with the bartenders chatting about their personal stuff. This was also the server hang out while they stood around waiting for drinks.  This is  not what you expect when you have a reservation.

==================================================

Review 15:
Thank you for your feedback, Daniela! We are happy to hear you enjoyed our offerings. We appreciate your comments on the vegetarian loaf and burgers, and we'll look into those. We apologize for the noise and seating issue—your experience is important to us, and we'll work to improve it. We hope to welcome you back soon! -Kiara

I've been here a few times but this time took part in happy hour!! My friend and I had great service even though the bar was packed. FYI HH is only at the bar. Loved the Constitution!! Would definitely get again!I ordered the skillet corn bread which I really enjoy because it has pieces of corn in it and comes with honey butter! Yummm. A lady who sat right next to us and became friends quite quickly had the tuna tacos which were delicious!!  My friend who I came with got the prosciutto jam bread which was also yummy!For dinner my friend got the fried chicken and I got the sausage, mushroom, and ricotta gnocchi, which was good just a smaller portion than what I was expecting.Too full for dessert and eager to see Ellen DeGeneres!

==================================================

Review 17:
Thank you for sharing your experience, Maria! We are thrilled to hear you enjoyed the happy hour and the Constitution. It’s great to know you liked the skillet cornbread and other dishes. We’ll take your feedback about the gnocchi portion into consideration. We look forward to seeing you and your friend again soon! -Kerry

This place seems to have as many visitors as the local monuments. We were visiting DC and had to stop by for dinner. It was really hard to choose from all the options on the menu but you can't go wrong with fried chicken. I was hesitant because I wasn't a fan of the sides but we were told that we can make any swaps! I went for the Mac and cheese instead of collard greens. The fried chicken was a really good meal, the mashed potatoes were surprisingly my favorite and I'm usually not a fan. I would try to balance out the sides though, since the meal is very heavy. Overall the entire meal portion was ginormous and easily could be shared between 2 people. We also tried the butternut squash ravioli and that was good but didn't stand out. We also got the fried green tomatoes for starters and they made for a nice savory appetizer. But since they're fried they can be too filling if not shared. Lastly what I loved about this place is that they had little pre packaged founding farmers chocolate boxes for $12 that made the best gifts to take back home.

Great service and delicious food. I sat at the bar but they have great outdoor seating too.Food was fresh and I had their dinner but wanted to try breakfast.Sausage wasn't for me, I asked for chicken but I think it was wrong but the juice was fresh so definitely get that.Bar service was quick but if it wasn't so hot I'd be outside.

We just arrived in DC and after checking into our hotel headed out to eat.  We had used Yelp before we arrived to find local restaurants that sounded interesting, and one was the Founding Farmers, just a couple of blocks away.  Walking in we found a loud vibrant place.  It was getting late so it wasn't as busy as other reviews describe.  We opted to sit inside on a warm evening and had only a 15 minute wait.  There were tables outside available immediately.There are several menu items I could have picked, I decided on their Yankee Pot Roast.  While it was a good dish, I found the pot roast itself was far from fork tender.  The star for me was my summer crop side, their Roasted Heirloom Carrots.  With their orange glaze I found them exceptionally good.I also remembered they offered homemade pies and talked my family into getting a slice of Coconut Cream Pie.  I think we were all too full so one large slice was plenty and a sweet ending to a nice meal.

Founding Farmers: Where the Fried Chicken Works Magic. I'm convinced there's a secret ingredient in their fried chicken batter - it's simply the best I've ever tasted! We loved it so much, we dined here twice during our three-day trip to DC, once for dinner and again for brunch.On Tuesday evening, the atmosphere was electric, with a lively crowd eagerly awaiting their tables. The scene reminded me of concert-goers lining up before a show. A helpful tip for those without reservations: try booking through OpenTable. We snagged a table within 15 minutes, while others waited in line for 45 minutes or more.During our dinner visit, we enjoyed the well-priced cocktails, the delicious (though slightly tame) skillet cornbread, and the Founder's platter, which offered a delightful sampler of their most popular dishes. The star of the show, however, was undoubtedly the fried chicken.Our brunch experience was equally satisfying, featuring the must-try chicken and waffles, a crispy fried chicken salad, and a hearty breakfast plate. Every dish we ordered was flavorful and well-prepared.The only minor hiccup was the service. On both occasions, I had to remind the staff about my request for hot sauce, which arrived towards the end of our meal. Despite this small issue, our overall experience was fantastic

I've been to this spot a couple of times and I enjoyed my experiences.
I was recently here for lunch and had the Kale Salad with Grilled Chicken. It was a good sized portion for lunch. The dressing was flavorful- I just asked for a light serving and that was perfect. I also had the Cornbread Skillet and that was a nice accompaniment to the salad. The cornbread had good corn flavor and texture and the nondairy honey butter was still pretty good - this is a great dish to share with the table.
The service has always been friendly.
This restaurant is a good option for families and large groups since the menus have so much variety.

This is a fantastic brunch spot in DC! The presentation of each dish is beautifully done, adding to the overall experience. I had the Founding Farmers breakfast, which comes with two eggs, a choice of meat, a side, and bread. I opted for the chicken and waffles with an egg, and it was absolutely delicious--especially with the white gravy on the side. Highly recommend this place for a great meal!

==================================================

Review 29:
Had a nice breakfast here! They had a nice long table for our large group. The menu has lots of tasty sounding options, though I decided to go for something simple and light. I got the avocado toast and egg whites which was very tasty even with how simple it is. Also ordered a chai latte which was very flavorful.

I decided to have dinner with the family at Founding Farmers after reading the reviews. First of all it's best to make a reservation or you could be waiting awhile +/- 30 minutes. The decor of the restaurant is gorgeous and the lay out flows very well throughout the restaurant. They do have outdoor seating as well as bar seating for dining. The customer service from beginning to end was very good and waiter did a great job taking care of us.
I ordered the Chicken and Waffle which seemed to be the best option considering that everything is "made from scratch" and they say their fried chicken is award winning. Let me get straight to the point, the chicken was good, tasty and crispy but it didn't have the soul food taste to it as you'd expect with chicken and waffles. I was disappointed but not every chicken and waffle dish is going to be great.
The macaroni and cheese as a side was good but not delicious, the green beans were bland and I needed to add salt and more salt to give it some semblance of flavor. Again, don't expect this to be a soul food experience and if that's not what you're looking for then you'll be fine.
My daughter had the cheeseburger and she said it was good but she wasn't impressed. My wife had the baby cheeseburgers and she said they were good. Overall, we had a great experience but the food was not the star of the evening.

While visiting in DC I heard great things about this restaurant and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did! Let me start off by saying.... I went on a Tuesday evening and it was packed! I did not have reservations so my wait was about 2 hours. People with reservations had a slight wait as well. I highly recommend making reservations before you go.
The staff/waiter was nice and friendly and recommended a few dishes. I got the garlic wings and biscuits as an appetizer AMAZING! Everyone was ordering the cornbread skillet so I wanted to try it but our order never came out (oversight on their behalf... maybe next time). As my main dish, I ordered the steak and enchiladas. The skirt steak with chimichurri sauce was excellent along with the street corn. I didn't really care for the chicken enchiladas (chick was a bit dry). My friend ordered the ribeye with mash potatoes and asparagus... she loved it! To top off our meal we got red wine and a margarita. The drinks were delicious.
I highly recommend this place. You will not be disappointed. A lot of items looked really good so I plan on going back once more before my trip ends so I can try something else and have another yummy margarita to go with my dinner.

Service was great! Homemade sodas were amazing! We shared the fried green tomatoes and the Turkey BLT! All was very yummy!

==================================================

Review 33:
We dined here and could tell it was a popular place. It was loud and bustling but in a good city restaurant way. The food is all made in house or sorted locally. We loved the Crab and Artichoke Cheese Dip for an appetizer.
For entrees we got the Pot Roast as well as the Shrimp and Grits. The Pot Roast was good but not amazing. The onions, carrots and celery were as if they just cut it raw and threw it in before serving. I like a veggie that has a crisp when cooked but these tasted raw. It was also overall just lukewarm. Flavor was good though. The Shrimp and Grits came out piping hot and was flavorful though should be called Shrimp Gumbo as it was served with what felt like a tablespoon of Grits.
We did enjoy it overall and they do have an expansive menu that would be worth trying again.

Review 34:
This location of Founding Farmers in downtown DC will always have sentimental value to me, since it was a regular haunt when I worked in the area back in the late-2000s as it was the site of many get togethers with professional colleagues and friends alike. And TBH, it's hard to believe that 2024 will mark the 16th year of operation!
After walking in past the revolving door, the small-ish waiting area is often cramped with folks waiting to be seated by the patient staff. The mostly dark color palette is accentuated by lighter hardwood floors, furniture, and tiles. Kudos to the management team for maintaining these public areas in good condition.
While I'm no longer attending Happy Hour gatherings, I do enjoy popping by the OG location for of all things, dessert! A friend and I came here after a performance at the Kennedy Center and were lucky enough to snag a table upstairs. Just my preference, but if given the choice, I will usually opt to sit upstairs since it's a bit quieter and there are fewer "acoustic challenges" as found in the downstairs dining area.
Our server recommended the Butterscotch Bread pudding to share...and it was an excellent choice indeed! A portion large enough for 2-3 people arrived with the top of the dish toasty and crumbly. Digging in, the bread was moist and had an amazing butterscotch flavor with hints of cinnamon and light sugar. Dunk a piece into the smooth vanilla sauce, and it's the perfect pairing.
All desserts are made in-house, and the quality is reflected in the finished product. If I'm downtown and want something to satisfy my sweet tooth, you won't go wrong with this place.
16,000+ reviews and counting for the original Founding Farmers location which started it all.

==================================================

Review 35:
Came last night for a late dinner with family. Balsamic blue bacon cheeseburger, shrimp and sun dried tomato pasta, turkey avocado blt and the shrimp and grits were our entrees. All very good but I believe that our server was a little slow on picking them up as all were not temperature hot but relatively warm. (Shrimp and grits sauce had congealed on the top).
All were delicious just wish they were warmer. Of note. Their spicy Paloma and FROZEN gin and tonic were great.

==================================================

Review 36:
Besides the service being pretty slow for lunch on a week day. The restaurant was not very crowded for its size and there were plenty of staff working that day, so no reason for slow service, but once we started getting taken care of there were no real complaints. Inside there is seating upstairs and downstairs, We were upstairs and I'm sure if we had a window seat there would be some decent views of surrounding buildings or maybe even a monument. One thing I also really enjoyed about this visit was the music that was playing, It was the perfect mix of good feeling upbeat music. * If you know the playlist please drop a compliment* lol
For food and drinks we both ordered iced coffees with oat milk. They offer flavors if you want, just no hazelnut which is my go to. Not a deal breaker, but it would have been nice. I'm here on a work trip from Charleston SC, so when I'am home and see shrimp and grits on the menu, that is an easy go to for me. After Ordering that here I think I will keep that for exclusively when I am down south. It wasn't bad, but surely wasn't great. I can't remember exactly what the sandwich was that my friend had ordered, but she had no complaints.
All in all great spot to meet work friends in the area for a bite to eat, there is also a full bar so im sure this is a popular spot for locals after work as well.

==================================================

Review 37:
I'm in town for a conference and saw this place had over 17,000 reviews. I GOTTA try it. We were greeted by a super nice gentlemen at the entrance and taken upstairs for breakfast. I had the eggs, bacon and seasoned tomatoes and upgraded my meal with the French toast. The crisp on the French toast was unreal. I almost felt fried, but it was so lite on the inside. The syrup is amazing and had a slight cinnamon flavor. The ambiance is awesome, very cute decor, good music volume, and friendly staff. If you're in the area... stop by!

==================================================

Review 38:
I was recommended this place off of social media. I was super excited to try it out as I've never been before. I had spent the day in the National Mall so it was a relatively short walk to get here from the White House. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered our drinks. We ordered a pork chop with Brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes and broccoli to share. The pork chop was succulent and juicy. The mashed potatoes were very creamy. The Brussels sprouts were AMAZING! So amazing we had to order an extra side of them. However, the broccoli was much to be desired. They were covered in some kind of sauce (?) that basically made them inedible. The flavor was not good and we ended up not finishing the dish. We were a bit surprised because when we ordered the extra side of Brussels sprouts it was the same amount of food as the broccoli side but cost double. We had supposedly ordered the "large" size but it looked more like the small. Overall we had decent service and the food was very good (minus the broccoli). The location inside was very cute and the bathroom was relatively clean. My only complaint about the bathroom was that they had no hand towels and only a hand dryer.

==================================================

Review 39:
Very good crab, the poached egg was closer to hard boiled. Hash browns were fine, not memorable.
French toast was dry in the middle. The cinnamon infused syrup on the table was very thin...not even really maple syrup. Still tasty.
Coffee and hot cocoa were not hot. Bloody Mary was okay but not great.
Service was great. Friendly and prompt. The place is cute and clean.
Over $100 including the wellness fee... Overall a decent experience, but not one to go out of our way for.

==================================================

Absolutely love how they source ingredients from family-farmed and local distributors and how everything is made in-house from scratch! For a starter, I tried their chicken dumplings. They were okay. I found the skin of the dumpling to be a bit thick and the filling to be a bit dense, but I loved the sauce they came in. For my main course, I enjoyed avocado poblano cheeseburger. It was a perfect medium rare, and it just felt so light with all the veggies included. The fries on the side were delicious too! Nothing to write home about, but a solid pairing with a solid burger. I split one of their vanilla cream-filled cronuts for dessert, and it was good but not what I'd expect from a good cronut. It was a bit too chewy and dense, and almost stale considering it was the end of the day. I could appreciate the layers, but the texture and consistency was more reminiscent of a stale Ozzie roll from the Great American Restaurants chain. Overall, a nice spot with an extensive menu and a wonderful mission statement.
