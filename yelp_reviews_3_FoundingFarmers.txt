I have been to Founding Farmers before and enjoyed it so when I was back in the city decided to check it out again; unfortunately this time the experience wasn't as great.we ordered the bried and bread to start off then we got the grilled cheese plus tomato soup with roasted veggies and the beef sandwich with farro salad.  everything came out together even though we ordered the bread first.  the bread and cheese were good but not worth the price they charged.  out of the other food, the grilled veggies were really good, the farro salad was not good, the tomato soup wasn't really a soup and the beef sandwich was average.  overall poor quality food and bad customer service

we had heard good things about founding farmers so decided to check it out.  we started off with bread, crisps and dips which came with really nice chips, average bread and ok crisps.  the dips were onion, pimento, avocado and another kind - some were decent others good.  we then got the veggie burger with the cornbread stuffing, the avocado toast and the veggie and brie sandwich with mashed potatoes.  the mashed potatoes and cornbread stuffing were excellent, the sandwich was decent and the burger and avocado toast were not goodoverall nice ambiance and decent food

Founding Farmers offers a classic American dining experience, but unfortunately, it didn't fully deliver in terms of service or some dishes.SERVICE - The service started off poorly with the hostess, who was noticeably standoffish and rude. She didn't make eye contact and seemed to disregard our presence entirely. Thankfully, our waiter was kind and friendly, which helped redeem the experience a bit.FOODDeviled Eggs - This was a miss for me. The texture was off, with a crunchy element (likely celery) that didn't belong. The flavor itself lacked depth, and somehow, even the egg flavor got lost. It just didn't come together well.Crazy Corn Chicken Salad - While the salad itself was flavorful, the kettle corn didn't quite work. It felt out of place and didn't pair well with the rest of the dish. I'd skip that next time.Farmhouse Platter - The fried chicken had great flavor but was a bit dry. The BBQ ribs were tough and didn't fall off the bone as expected. The baby cheeseburgers were fine--nothing special. However, the street corn and slaw were both refreshing and a highlight of the dish.Butternut Squash Ravioli - The ravioli was a bit too soft for my taste. I prefer pasta to be more al dente. However, the flavor was a nice balance of sweet and savory, which made it enjoyable overall.Lemon Garlic Broccoli - This was the surprise standout of the meal. The flavor was fantastic--so good that I usually don't pay much attention to my broccoli, but I finished this quickly. Definitely worth ordering as your veggie.While Founding Farmers has some great dishes, there were a few misses, especially with service and certain food items. The atmosphere was decent, but the service hiccups and inconsistent food left me wishing for a more polished experience. I'd still give it another try, but I'm not sure it will be my first choice next time.

We made reservations for 8:45am but the sign said they opened at 9:00am. Luckily, they did in fact open at 8:45am. People were already standing outside waiting! Ethan was our waiter and he was really great. Fast and friendly!Beignets - I've never had a beignet before so I have nothing to compare them. Regardless, these were delicious! Came out hot and fresh. They were soft, moist and flaky. It reminded me of a donut/funnel cake/croissant. My fiancé loved these. He was already full from his entree but couldn't leave without finishing the beignets. Chicken and Waffles - The chicken was a lot better than from our dinner last night at Central Michel. Nicely battered and moist. Waffle was huge and fluffy. The gravy on the side was a nice touch. Roasted Veggie Scramble w/ Chicken Sausage - This came with your choice of a side and bread. I went with the hash browns and multigrain toast. Scramble but good but nothing mind blowing. Something you could throw together at home. Hash browns were generic as well as their toast.Overalls, solid breakfast place. Definitely get the beignets when you come!

Review 11:
I was so excited to head back to Founding Farmers after some time and unfortunately, it left me feeling a little disappointed. We had 6pm reservations, arrived early but were not seated until 6:20pm. Our server was friendly and nice but the poor girl got double sat and we knew she was going to be running. They have the tables all packed in there. All we could hear was the conversation right next to us. Not the best place for a date night. Our drinks took a long time coming from the bar. The highlight was the prosciutto bread. My meal was not that great. The server misheard me and I got what I didn't order. I didn't say anything cause honestly, I just didn't care to be bothered. My husband's steak was alright. Nothing too great. With other amazing places in the city, this place ranked last on all our meals this trip.

Another great visit! This is a must visit anytime we are in DC. This trip did not disappoint. We ordered the deviled eggs and pickled vegetables for our starters. Both are our favorites! Simple but flavorful. I opted for the chicken and waffles, which is a first for me! I was pleasantly surprised at how good the two together can be! The mac and cheese side is amazingly good and I will definitely order just that next time. I'd also like to try the cornbread too. The chicken was fried perfectly. Crispy and not oily. It had a lot of flavor. The chicken gravy side was quite tasty too. The waffles were good but became super soggy after a while. I also ordered the seasonal escabeche which I was super excited about (Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, carrots and onions) but it was a dud. My bowl was nothing but carrots! My daughter ordered the same thing and she had a good mix of all the veggies. Other entrees ordered were the rice and bean burger with smoked tofu and the seasonal chili (beef, veggies and bacon). Both dishes were delicious and enjoyed! We finished our meal off with the triple layer chocolate mousse cake which was rich and decadent. Perfect end to our meal!

Had really high hopes for Founding Farmers with all the positive reviews. Made a reservation on Open Table. The place was packed but service was good. Let me start with the food. I ordered the prime rib and it was served cold. That was really disappointing The mushroom gnocchi was just okay. Not too much flavor was more on the bland side.. The corn bread was probably my favorite thing we ordered. The service and vibe was good. I was let down by the food.

I wanted to love this restaurant, but it fell short. I really wish that when serving hot chocolate with whipped cream on top these restaurants would make sure they are starting with really hot cocoa because when it gets to the table it is already cold. If I wanted chocolate milk, I would have ordered that instead. My husband barely touched his $6 cup of cocoa. He did enjoy the beignets, which were light, fluffy and plentiful. The ham on my Benedict was dried out and the hollandaise had an unexpected kick to it, which was off-putting since I am not a fan of spicy foods. Perhaps they overdid it with the cayenne pepper. Hash browns were good. I might give it another try, when in the area, as omelettes looked very good.

Service could've been a little better and the food was just ok on this visit. My first visit was amazing, but my second visit left more to be desired. Will possibly try it again, as maybe it wasn't a good day for the chef.

We stopped in for lunch after visiting the WhiteHouse. The restaurant had a lively vibe and the bathrooms were nice and clean. Our server was great and gave recommendations of what to get since the menu can be overwhelming. My daughter had the spatchcock chicken, hubs had the fried chicken, I had the pastrami melt, and my son the baby cheeseburgers (3). Note that they offer canned sodas or house made sodas which we tried, and no refills. Overall the food was good but not something that wowed me. For a solid lunch this place will fit the bill. My pastrami melt could've been better as it seemed more like a sandwich with toasted bread and tons of slaw. My brussel sprouts were a bit al dente for my liking and needed more seasoning. Solid lunch spot.

Thank you for stopping in for lunch and sharing your feedback, Jules! We're glad you enjoyed the lively atmosphere and service. We'll definitely take your comments on the food into consideration as we always strive to improve. We hope to welcome you back for another visit! -Tiffany

Review 23:
A long queue to enter this popular restaurant made me want to check it out for breakfast. One word comes to mind - "Meh". Albeit, o no the positive side of 'meh'. The chicken and waffles were good. The fluffiest waffle I ever had!  I liked the opportunity to sit outside as well.  So why only three stars. It has that chain restaurant feeling. The staff work really hard, but there simply not enough of them. Then again, it is Labor Day, so maybe they were short staffed. I don't think I'll be coming here again. It's not a bad place, just not my cup of tea.

This restaurant can be hot or miss. I've come to prefer the Tyson's outlet over dc. Ordered scallops and they were very overcooked and dry alongside a less than creamy risotto. Frustrating when the meal has such potential that is missed by rushed kitchen staff not paying attention to the menu. Date had the chicken and waffles which he enjoyed but nothing to write home about. Restaurant was busy and we were seated close to our reservation time. Staff was nice enough but I didn't feel like anyone provided outstanding long service but moreover just checking the boxes as they milled about.

Review 27:
I stopped by Founding Farmers on my way to the airport for a quick brunch. My coworkers and I were traveling with luggage, so of course we were looking a little clunky. When we walked in, the hostess asked if we wanted to put our luggage to the side of the entrance, so we did. While doing this, we noticed another worker, standing next to the podium, was just staring at us. And it wasn't a friendly stare either... we felt uncomfortable. Moving on, we sat down and looked at the menu to order. Here's what I had:Aztec Latte - this latte is unique in that it uses cayenne in the drink. As a result, it's spicy. The heat is enough to coat the back of your throat and give you a warming sensation. I liked it because I can handle my heat, but if you can't then I recommend getting the chai latte instead. If ordering this drink, have a glass of water on the side so you can have something more refreshing to cleanse your palate while eating! Breakfast Chicken & Waffles - I was a bit disappointed with this dish, with my main disappointment being the chicken and waffles. The chicken portion felt small, but most importantly (to me) it was not as crunchy as I was expecting. The fried portion was soggy. The waffles have a different texture; it's crispy, but very airy and light, though lacked flavor on its own. It tasted good, but didn't necessarily wow me. The waffles gave me Eggo cinnamon french toast stick vibes. Normally I would like to add maple syrup to this dish, but the maple syrup they have on the side has cinnamon sticks in it, which I didn't want the cinnamon flavor on a savory dish. I would come back to try other dishes for future opportunities, but unfortunately it would be difficult since I was only visiting for a few days. We didn't have a good experience with the worker staring at us prior to seating, but the server who served us was nice and friendly. Overall, my experience was okay.

We dined outside. Very very busy.
Staff were attentive and helpful.
The food was decent. Price was steep. 5 plates plus dessert around $230 not including tip. No kids menu.
Waffles was delicious. Had a cinnamon taste - don't think I got a pic but basic Belgian type waffle.
The beef short rib, mashed potatoes and roasted autumn veggies with apple glaze delightful. Would return specifically for this dish.
Chicken enchiladas were decent. The steak that accompanied not so good.
Green beans were terrible just blanched .
Dessert was also a miss.

==================================================

Review 31:
The service was friendly and patient.
Today's Rickey was a great non alcoholic drink.
The flavor of the chicken pot pie was good but the overall dish wasn't what I expected. The ratio of bread to filling (chicken, veggies) and was way off. It was a lot of bread and not enough chicken. The bread is more croissant-like rather than pie-like.
The dark chocolate caramel cookie was fantastic, not too sweet, and good quality chocolate.

==================================================

Review 32:
This place has really gone downhill. I always loved the vibe and ambiance as I've dined often for business meetings for many years. Not only did they charge me for an appetizer I didn't receive, but I was told marketing would be in touch for a make good due to poor service (our server didn't even check in on us), inaccurate billing and food that arrived late and cold! Never heard from them. Eek! Below is a picture of my chicken and waffles and super bland dessert. The portions are much smaller than they were in the past. DC has countless better dinner options. Just no!

==================================================

Review 33:
Let me start off by saying, the food was good however I was expecting more because a lot of people gave this place 5 star reviews. We chose this place based on the high Yelp reviews and although our experience wasn't bad, there was nothing we ate that deserved 5 stars. Nonetheless, we were seated quickly and our server, Byron, was courteous and helpful. The ambiance was welcoming, I even saw I guy walk in with two dogs.
We ordered Scratch sodas (Vanilla and ginger) and the Farmer Girl(?) to drink. My friend raved about the Scratch ginger soda but the vanilla not so much. For appetizers we had Brie toast and artichoke dip, both were good. As for meals, we had a veggie burger, chicken and waffles, fried chicken and mash potatoes and a soup and salad.
All of our reviews averaged 3 stars. The veggie burger and chicken and waffles were crowd pleasers and the rest was mid.
I did like that they offer homemade chocolates on their dessert menu.

==================================================

Review 34:
Add this place to the list of tourist traps dedicated to our founding fathers.
Every single person I talked to recommended this place and it was good not great.
The place was a very cute brunch spot and service was incredible and behind friendly. I just wish the food were as good as the people bringing it to you.

==================================================

Review 35:
SO packed with people - over an hour wait for a table, so we opted to sit at the bar. The service received was great, Luan was our bartender/server and was fantastic. The food was delicious in taste and good in portion, BUT vegetables on both dishes were severely undercooked- essentially raw! My husband has dietary restrictions due to an illness and cannot eat raw veggies, so he had to leave them and of course remained hungry. We also ordered cornbread on a skillet, but my husband was also unable to eat it, as it had whole corn kernels in it (never seen this). The whole kernels were not mentioned on the menu either.

==================================================

Review 36:
We had reservations for brunch in a Saturday and sat outside. The inside of the restaurant was crowded but the hostess was efficient and friendly and they sat parties fairly quickly. They seem well versed in dealing with a high volume of patrons and that was pretty impressive.
The food and service , unfortunately, was lacking. Our server was friendly, but the food was not hot when it finally came out and we had to ask for everything separately (hot sauce, ketchup, napkins, salt and pepper ...none of that was at the table or brought with our savory breakfasts. Tea came out late as did our juice. The food was just okay - nothing spectacular about any of it and it was pretty expensive for the amount of food that came with each order.
At over 17,000 reviews, I expected much more from Founding Farmers. Perhaps the sweeter breakfasts (French toast, pancakes etc.) are better than the eggs and omelets, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back and try.

==================================================

Review 37:
We made a reservation online for the Founding Farmers because the restaurant is always busy.
When we arrived we waited about 10 minutes but the restaurant was packed.
Service was slow, coffee was average it had a bad after taste.
When the food finally arrived I was kind of disappointed. My biscuits were hard on the top, and I wanted my hash browns well done and they weren't. I was amazed how they make their grits. At first I thought corn was in the grits but it wasn't corn - the grits were extremely lumpy.
The experience was average - maybe I ordered the wrong thing - I'm not sure. If I go back I will order something different and definitely stay away from the grits.

==================================================

Review 38:
There is street metered parking or a paid parking garage. The decor is more modern with a bar and 2 levels of seating. We were seated quickly, the service to take our order was quick. The hashbrowns needed more of a crunch to them, the sausage was okay, the jam was really good but overall the breakfast was just okay. I tried the hollandaise sauce and it was too much mayo for me.

==================================================

Review 39:
We came here for brunch and overall it was ok. Although the staff was friendly, they didn't really seem on top of things. First of all, our food took over 30 minutes to order. Also, we didn't have utensils and basically had to ask for them. My utensils were super hot, probably because they had just come out of the dishwasher. I also had to separately ask for a spoon since I got a yogurt bowl. The food itself was very mediocre. We got a yogurt bowl, eggs and toast, and chicken and waffles. The yogurt bowl was ok, but could have at least been chilled. I also got a blueberry muffin, and although fresh out the oven, could have been better. The eggs were ok, but the bread had an odd texture. It felt like it was reheated in the microwave or something. Also the chicken and waffles came with a big waffle, but one small piece of chicken.

==================================================

Review 40:
Good but not great food. I was not wow'ed by the pot pie or the brussel sprouts side. However, super friendly and efficient service behind the bar. I'm sure they have many more delicious options on the menu but I honestly wasn't impressed by the flavor combinations, sauces, or ingredients from what I read. Definitely more of a traditional rather than modern American restaurant. Not a MUST go when in DC.
